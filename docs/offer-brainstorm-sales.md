## 1. The Brutal Math You Must Accept

Before anything else: the reason you have zero leads is not your website, your pricing, or your portfolio. It is that nobody knows you exist as an independent operator. Your website is a brochure sitting in an empty room. The room needs bodies in it. That is your only job for the next 90 days.

### What you actually need to do every day

At your price points ($7,500-$15,000 projects, $1,200-$2,500/month retainers), here is the pipeline math:

| Stage | Conversion Rate | Volume Needed/Month |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Outreach touches (cold + warm) | -- | 200-300 |
| Conversations started | 8-12% of touches | 20-30 |
| Discovery calls booked | 40% of conversations | 8-12 |
| Proposals sent | 70% of calls | 6-8 |
| Deals closed | 25-33% of proposals | 2-3 |
| Average deal value | $6,000-$8,000 | -- |
| **Monthly revenue** | -- | **$12,000-$24,000** |

That is 10-15 outreach touches per business day. Every single day. That is your non-negotiable number.

### The uncomfortable truth

You are not starting a consultancy. You are starting a sales operation that happens to deliver consulting. For the first 90 days, you are a salesperson who can also build websites. Not the other way around. If you spend 6 hours building and 1 hour selling, you will starve. If you spend 3 hours selling and 4 hours building, you will eat.

### Your unfair advantages (use them)

1. **13 years and 100+ projects.** No junior freelancer can match this. Lead with it.
2. **Fortune 500 credibility.** Northern Trust is a household name in Chicago financial circles. Drop it early and often.
3. **The Sparkblox scar.** You raised $1M and it failed. This makes you more credible with business owners, not less. You understand their risk. You have skin-in-the-game empathy.
4. **Full-stack execution.** You are the rarest of breeds: someone who can think strategically AND build the thing. No handoffs, no telephone game.
5. **AI leverage.** You can deliver 3-5x the output of a traditional freelancer. This is your margin advantage. Do not sell it -- pocket it.
6. **Cleveland/Chicago network.** 6 years at Comrade. Enterprise contracts. Sparkblox investors. You know hundreds of people. Most of them do not know you went independent.

## 2. Outbound Strategy: Where to Find Clients This Week

### Channel 1: The Warm Network Blitz (Week 1 -- highest ROI, do this first)

You have a network. You have not activated it. This is the fastest path to revenue because trust already exists.

#### Build your hit list (Day 1 -- spend 2 hours on this)

Open LinkedIn, your phone contacts, your email, and write down every name in these categories:

| Category | Target Names | Expected Count |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Former Comrade colleagues (PMs, devs, designers, account managers, owners) | Everyone you remember | 15-25 |
| Former Comrade clients you had direct contact with | Check your old email | 10-20 |
| Northern Trust contacts | Roman Panchyshyn + anyone else | 3-5 |
| MDRT contacts | Direct stakeholders | 2-5 |
| DEPT/Melon contacts | Colleagues and contacts | 5-10 |
| Sparkblox network (co-founders, investors, advisors, board, customers) | Everyone from the startup | 10-15 |
| Friends and family who own businesses or work at businesses | Think hard | 10-20 |
| Former classmates who are now business owners or in marketing | LinkedIn scan | 5-10 |
| Acquaintances from Chicago tech/startup scene | Meetups, events, online communities | 5-10 |

**Target: 50-100 names minimum.** You have been in this industry for 13 years. You know these people. They just do not know you went solo.

#### The message sequence

**Day 1-3:** Send personalized 1:1 messages to every person on the list. Not a mass blast. Personalized. Different messages for different categories.

For former colleagues (the referral ask):

> Hey [Name] -- hope things are going well at [wherever they are now]. Quick update from my end: I left [agency/company] and launched my own practice. After 13 years doing this at agencies and enterprise, I'm working directly with businesses now -- websites, apps, digital growth strategy -- senior-level work without the agency overhead.
>
> I'm not asking you for anything specific. But if you ever hear a business owner complain about their website, their SEO, or their digital presence not pulling its weight -- I'd love the introduction. I'll make you look good.
>
> How are things on your end?

For business owners in your network (the direct offer):

> Hey [Name] -- wanted to give you a heads up that I've gone independent. After 13 years building digital products (including work for Northern Trust and 100+ small business projects at Comrade agency), I'm working directly with business owners now.
>
> I'm doing something for my first few clients that I won't be able to do later: a free 20-minute strategy session where I'll pull up your website, your competitors, and your Google presence and give you a straight diagnostic of what's working and what's costing you customers. No pitch. Genuinely useful regardless.
>
> Worth 20 minutes?

For Sparkblox contacts (the entrepreneur angle):

> Hey [Name] -- it's been a while since Sparkblox days. I'm doing something new: took everything I learned building products (including the hard lessons from Sparkblox) and all my years in web/UX, and I'm running an independent digital growth practice for small and mid-size businesses.
>
> You talk to a lot of business owners and founders. If anyone ever mentions they need help with their website or digital presence, I'd be grateful for the intro. Happy to return the favor any way I can.

**Volume target:** 50 messages in 3 days. Expect 25-35 responses within a week. Expect 5-10 warm leads (some combination of "I might need help" and "I know someone who does"). Expect 3-5 calls booked.

#### The LinkedIn announcement (Day 3-4)

After the personal messages have gone out, go public. One post. Human, direct, no corporate speak.

> After 13 years designing and building digital products -- from Fortune 500 financial services to startups that raised millions (and one that failed spectacularly) -- I'm going independent.
>
> I started at Comrade Web Agency, where I led 100+ projects for small businesses. I designed animation systems for Northern Trust. I co-founded Sparkblox, raised $1M, and learned more from that failure than from anything that succeeded. I led UX at DEPT.
>
> Now I'm taking all of it and working directly with business owners who need their digital presence to actually grow their business.
>
> The practice is Nice Right. If you know a business owner frustrated with their website or online presence, I'd love an introduction. And if that's you -- let's talk.
>
> niceright.co

Post it. Do not edit it 14 times. Do not wait for the "right moment." Post it and move on.

### Channel 2: The Loom Video Blitz (Week 2+ -- highest conversion cold tactic)

This is the single most effective outbound tactic for a web consultant. It works because you demonstrate competence before asking for anything. The prospect sees their own website on screen with a real expert diagnosing real problems. The effort signal (you made this just for them) differentiates you from every template cold email they have ever received.

#### How it works

1. Find a local business (start with Cleveland/Chicago, expand to national later)
2. Pull up their website on your screen
3. Open a screen recorder (Loom -- free tier is fine)
4. Record a 3-5 minute video reviewing their site with specific, actionable observations
5. Send it to the business owner with a short email

#### What to say in the video

Do not pitch. Diagnose. You are a doctor showing an X-ray, not a salesman showing a brochure.

**Template structure for the video:**

- "Hey [Name], I'm Marcin, I run a digital growth practice here in [city]. I was looking at businesses in [their industry] and pulled up your site. I noticed a few things that might be costing you customers, so I recorded this quick video."
- **Issue 1 (mobile):** Pull up their site on mobile emulation. "About 65-70% of your visitors are on their phone. Here's what they see..." Point out specific problems -- slow load, broken layout, buried contact info.
- **Issue 2 (SEO/search):** Google their main keyword + city. "When I search '[their service] [their city],' you're showing up [here]. Your competitor [name] is showing up [here]. That gap is probably costing you [X] calls per month."
- **Issue 3 (conversion):** "Your contact form is [X clicks deep / hard to find / too many fields]. Every extra step loses about 20% of visitors."
- Close: "No strings attached -- just wanted to share what I saw. If any of this is useful and you want to dig deeper, I'm happy to do a 15-minute call. Either way, hope business is going well."

#### The email that goes with the video

**Subject:** Quick video about [Business Name]'s website

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm Marcin -- I run a digital growth practice based in [city]. I was looking at [industry] businesses in the area and noticed a few things on your site that might be costing you customers.
>
> I recorded a quick 3-minute walkthrough:
> [Loom link]
>
> No pitch, no agenda. If any of it resonates and you want to talk about it, I'm around.
>
> Marcin
> Nice Right | niceright.co

#### Where to find the businesses

| Source | How to Use It | Volume |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Google Maps | Search "[industry] [city]" -- click through listings | Unlimited |
| Yelp | Filter by 3-4 stars (they have customers but room to grow) | High |
| Chamber of Commerce directories | Cleveland, Chicago, or any metro | Medium |
| Industry association member lists | HVAC contractor associations, restaurant associations, dental associations | Medium |
| Facebook local business groups | Join 3-5 groups, note who's active | Medium |
| Drive around your area | Write down every business with a storefront | Low but high conversion |
| Clutch.co / Yelp / Google reviews | Find businesses with complaints about online presence | Medium |

#### Which industries to target (in order of priority)

Based on your Comrade agency experience and the SMB market:

1. **Home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, landscaping).** You have the 290% traffic growth story from this sector at Comrade. These businesses have high customer lifetime value ($500-$5,000 per job), they desperately need leads, and they can afford $7,500-$15,000.

2. **Professional services (dental, chiropractic, law, accounting, financial advisors).** High LTV per customer ($2,000-$50,000+). They understand the concept of "investing in growth." They can afford premium pricing and retainers.

3. **Restaurants and food service.** Lower budgets but extremely high volume of prospects. Good for founding clients and case studies. You already mention building "a restaurant's entire web presence over a weekend."

4. **Healthcare (clinics, senior care, specialty practices).** Your healthcare real estate case study gives you credibility. High LTV, compliance-aware, willing to pay for quality.

5. **Local retail and e-commerce.** Good for landing page sprints and quick wins.

#### Volume and cadence

| Activity | Daily | Weekly | Monthly |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Loom videos recorded and sent | 4 | 20 | 80 |
| Time per Loom (research + record + email) | 15-20 min each | -- | -- |
| Total daily time | 60-80 min | -- | -- |

**Expected conversion:**
- 20 Looms/week x 30-40% view rate = 6-8 views
- 6-8 views x 50% response rate = 3-4 conversations
- 3-4 conversations x 30% call rate = 1 discovery call/week
- 4-5 calls/month x 25-33% close rate = 1-2 new engagements/month

These numbers are conservative. Some weeks will produce nothing. Some weeks will produce three calls. The math works across months, not across days.

#### Follow-up sequence (non-negotiable)

Most people stop after one touch. That is why most people fail. Follow up three times.

**Day 0:** Send the Loom.

**Day 3 (if no response):**

> Hi [Name], just making sure the video I sent didn't get buried -- I found a few things on your website that might be worth fixing. Here's the link again: [Loom]. Happy to chat for 15 minutes if any of it resonated.

**Day 10 (if still no response):**

> Hey [Name] -- last note from me. The video review of [Business Name]'s site is still here: [link]. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. Wishing you a great [month/season].

After three touches, stop. Do not follow up again. Move to the next prospect.

### Channel 3: LinkedIn DMs (ongoing, 15-30 min/day)

Best for B2B, professional services, and business owners who are active on LinkedIn.

#### The process

**Step 1: Connect.** Send 10-15 connection requests per day to business owners in your target industries and geographies. Use a short, non-salesy note:

> Hi [Name] -- fellow [city] business professional here. I work in digital strategy and saw your post about [topic]. Would love to connect.

Or, if they have not posted recently:

> Hi [Name] -- I help [industry] businesses grow through their digital presence. Noticed you're in [city] -- always good to connect with local business owners.

**Step 2: Give value (1-2 days after they accept).** Do NOT pitch. Give them something useful about their own business:

> Thanks for connecting. I took a quick look at [Business Name]'s site -- really like [specific thing you genuinely appreciate]. One thought: [one specific, actionable observation they could implement themselves, no strings attached]. Just figured it might be useful.

**Step 3: Let them come to you.** If they respond positively, continue the conversation naturally. If they ask "how can you help me?" -- that is your cue to offer the free strategy call. If they do not respond, do not follow up with a pitch. Just engage with their content over time.

**Step 4: Content engagement.** Spend 10-15 minutes per day commenting on posts from business owners in your target market. Not "Great post!" -- actual substantive comments that demonstrate expertise. This puts your name in front of them repeatedly before you ever DM them.

---

### Channel 4: Cold Email (start Month 2, after domain warming)

Cold email is a volume play. It works when automated, warmed properly, and personalized at the first line.

#### Setup (Week 1-2, runs in background)

- Buy a separate sending domain (e.g., marcinweb.com or niceright-growth.com). Never cold email from your primary domain.
- Set up DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) on the new domain.
- Use a sending tool: Instantly.ai ($30/month) or Smartlead ($39/month).
- Warm the domain for 14 days: send 5-10 emails/day to friends, colleagues, personal contacts who will open and reply.
- Use Apollo.io (free tier: 50 credits/month, paid: $49/month) or Hunter.io to find business owner emails.
- Verify every email with ZeroBounce or NeverBounce before sending.

#### The cold email (short, specific, human)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]

> Hi [Name],
>
> I help [industry] businesses in [city] get more customers from their website. I took a look at [Business Name]'s site and noticed [one specific, genuine observation].
>
> I recently worked with a similar [industry] business and helped them grow traffic by 290% and increase leads by 12x.
>
> Would a 15-minute call be worth it to see if something similar is possible for you?
>
> Marcin
> Nice Right | niceright.co

**Volume after warming:**
- Week 3: 10-15/day
- Week 4: 20-30/day
- Month 2+: 30-50/day (if deliverability stays above 95%)

**Expected results:**
- 50/day x 5 days = 250/week
- 3-5% positive response rate = 8-12 interested replies/week
- 50% book a call = 4-6 calls/week (at scale)

---

### Channel 5: Local Networking and Walk-ins (1-2x/week)

Underrated because it is uncomfortable. That is exactly why it works -- no other web consultant is doing it.

#### Networking events

Join 2-3 of these and attend consistently:

- **BNI (Business Network International)** -- structured referral group. Members are required to refer. This is designed for exactly your situation. Cleveland has multiple chapters. Cost: ~$500-$700/year.
- **Local Chamber of Commerce** -- Cleveland, or whichever suburb you are in. Attend mixers and "Business After Hours" events. Cost: $200-$500/year.
- **SCORE workshops** -- free business mentoring events. The attendees are business owners actively working on growth. Perfect prospects.
- **Local tech/startup meetups** -- Meetup.com, Eventbrite. Not for clients directly but for referral partners and agency connections.
- **Industry-specific trade shows and expos** -- Home service expos, restaurant industry events, dental conventions. Walk the floor. Talk to exhibitors. They all have websites that need help.

#### Cold walk-ins (the power move)

1. Walk into a local business during a slow time (Tuesday 2pm, not Saturday noon).
2. Be a customer first. Buy something. Eat there. Get the service.
3. Talk to the owner naturally. When they mention anything about business challenges, say: "I actually help businesses with that. I do digital strategy -- I look at how your website and online presence are performing and figure out how to bring in more customers."
4. Offer a free review of their online presence.
5. Exchange cards or numbers.
6. Follow up the next day with a Loom video of their site.

**Volume:** 2-3 per week. Low volume, but the conversion rate is extremely high because you have built a human relationship before any sales conversation.

---

### Channel 6: Agency Subcontracting (the bridge income)

While you build the direct-client pipeline, agency subcontracting provides predictable income. This is not your long-term play. It is the floor that keeps you alive while the ceiling gets built.

#### Who to reach out to

- Former colleagues at Comrade and DEPT who are now at other agencies
- Clutch.co and DesignRush: search for agencies in Cleveland, Chicago, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Detroit. Filter by 10-50 employees (small enough to need subcontractors, large enough to have work)
- LinkedIn: search "agency owner" or "creative director" in your region

#### The agency pitch email

**Subject:** Senior web/UX capacity -- overflow and white-label

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm Marcin Dabrowski -- 13 years in web/UX, previously led projects at Comrade Web Agency (100+ projects), designed systems for Northern Trust, and led UX at DEPT. I've gone independent and have capacity for white-label and overflow work.
>
> Stack: React, Next.js, Figma, WordPress, Shopify. Comfortable working under your brand, within your tools, at your standards. I spent 8 years inside agencies -- I know how the workflow works.
>
> Happy to do a trial project at a competitive rate so you can evaluate quality.
>
> Portfolio: niceright.co/work
>
> Worth a 15-minute call?
>
> Marcin

#### Rates for agency work

| Service | Your Rate to Agency | Agency Bills Client |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Frontend development | $90-$120/hr | $150-$250/hr |
| UX/UI design | $100-$130/hr | $175-$275/hr |
| Full-stack (design + dev) | $100-$140/hr | $175-$300/hr |
| Strategy / discovery | $110-$150/hr | $200-$350/hr |

Target: 2-3 agency relationships sending you 15-25 hours/month each = $3,000-$8,000/month in predictable base income.

---

### Channel Priority by Week

| Week | Primary Channel | Secondary Channel | Daily Time on Sales |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 | Warm network blitz (50 messages) | LinkedIn announcement | 3-4 hours |
| Week 2 | Loom video outreach (4/day) | Warm network follow-ups | 3 hours |
| Week 3 | Loom outreach + first discovery calls | LinkedIn DMs (10-15/day) | 3 hours |
| Week 4 | Loom outreach + proposals + closes | Agency outreach (5-10 emails) | 3 hours |
| Week 5-8 | Loom outreach + cold email launch | LinkedIn DMs + networking events | 2.5-3 hours |
| Week 9-12 | All channels running | Referral engine activating | 2-2.5 hours |

---

## 3. The Pitch: 30 Seconds, 5 Minutes, and the Full Close

### The 30-Second Pitch (cocktail party, networking event, random encounter)

When someone asks "What do you do?" -- this is the moment that either opens a door or shuts one. Most consultants blow it with a vague answer like "I do web design" or a long answer nobody asked for.

**The formula:** Name the problem + name who you solve it for + prove you are real.

**Version 1 (for business owners):**

> "You know how most small businesses pay for a website and it never brings in a single customer? I fix that. I've done it over a hundred times -- everything from local plumbers to Northern Trust. I figure out why a business is invisible online and build what fixes it."

**Version 2 (for professionals who might refer):**

> "I'm a digital growth architect for small businesses. Basically, when a business owner's website isn't pulling its weight -- not showing up on Google, not converting visitors into calls -- I diagnose the problem and build the fix. 13 years, 100+ projects, including Fortune 500 work. If you ever hear someone complain about their website, that's me."

**Version 3 (for agency people):**

> "I'm a senior web/UX practitioner -- 13 years, including Comrade agency and Northern Trust. I went independent. I do overflow and white-label work for agencies that need senior-level execution without the full-time headcount."

#### What to say AFTER the pitch

Stop talking. Ask a question. The worst thing you can do is keep selling after the pitch. Instead:

- "What about you -- what kind of business are you in?"
- "Do you ever deal with [their likely pain point based on their industry]?"
- "What's your biggest growth challenge right now?"

The goal is to get them talking about their problems. Every minute they talk about their problems is a minute closer to them hiring you.

---

### The 5-Minute Discovery Call Pitch

This is for when you have a business owner on a 20-minute call. The structure is 80% listening, 20% talking.

#### Phase 1: Situation (5 minutes) -- LISTEN

Your opening:

> "Thanks for taking the time. Before I talk about what I do, I want to understand your business. Tell me: what does a great month look like for you?"

Then shut up and ask these questions (you do not ask all of them -- follow the conversation):

**Business questions:**
- "How do most of your customers find you right now?"
- "What happens when someone visits your website? Do they call, fill out a form, just browse?"
- "Roughly how many people visit your site each month?" (Most will not know. That is a data point.)
- "What would one additional customer per week be worth to your business?"

**Pain questions:**
- "When was the last time your website was updated?"
- "What's your biggest frustration with your online presence?"
- "Have you worked with a web developer or agency before? How did that go?"

**Decision questions (qualifying):**
- "If we figured out a clear plan to fix this, what would the timeline look like for you?"
- "Is this something you'd make the call on, or would you bring someone else into the decision?"

What you are really doing: qualifying. You need to know:
- Do they have a real business with real revenue? (If revenue is under $300K, they probably cannot afford you.)
- Is their website actually the bottleneck? (If their real problem is no product-market fit, you cannot help.)
- Have they been burned before? (This affects your close strategy -- see objection handling.)
- Are they the decision maker?
- Do they have budget awareness?

#### Phase 2: Problem Amplification (5 minutes) -- DIAGNOSE

Transition:

> "That makes sense. Let me share something I noticed before our call..."

This is where you share the free insight you prepared. Be specific:

> "I pulled up your site on my phone. The first thing I noticed is [specific issue]. For a [their business type], about 65% of your visitors are on mobile. If the mobile experience is broken, you're losing more than half your potential customers before they even see your offer."

> "I searched '[their service] [their city]' on Google. You're on page 3. Your competitor [Name] is position 1. Based on typical search volumes, that gap is costing you somewhere around [X] inquiries per month."

> "Your homepage takes 6.2 seconds to load on mobile. Google's data shows that 53% of visitors leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds. You're hemorrhaging traffic."

Then ask the money question:

> "If I had to guess, based on what I'm seeing, your website is costing you somewhere between $[X] and $[Y] per month in lost business. Does that feel about right?"

If they say yes (or even "maybe"), you have established the cost of the problem. Your fee is now measured against that cost, not against Squarespace.

**How to calculate the loss on the fly:**

- Get their average customer value (ask: "What's a typical job/sale worth to you?")
- Estimate lost leads per month (usually 5-20 based on their search visibility and site problems)
- Multiply: "If your average job is $500 and you're losing even 5 leads per month to these issues, that's $2,500/month -- $30,000 a year."

This is the moment the prospect recalculates the value of fixing the problem.

#### Phase 3: Vision + Credibility (5 minutes) -- SHOW THE PATH

> "Here's what I've seen work for businesses like yours. I worked with a home service company that had a similar situation -- good business, terrible website. After we rebuilt their online presence with the right strategy, their traffic grew 290% and leads increased 12x. Same business, same market -- just a digital presence that was built to perform."

Then position the next step:

> "I don't want to prescribe anything on a 20-minute call. That's like a doctor writing a prescription before running tests. What I recommend is a diagnostic -- I spend 48 hours doing a deep dive into your site, your competitors, your local market, and deliver a clear picture of exactly what's costing you customers and exactly what to fix. You can take that plan and implement it yourself, hire someone else, or work with me. Either way, you walk away knowing where you stand."

#### Phase 4: Close (5 minutes) -- ASK FOR THE NEXT STEP

> "The diagnostic is $750. I deliver it in 48 hours. It includes a performance scorecard, a competitor comparison, and a video walkthrough of my findings. If we decide to work together on a full project, $500 of that gets credited toward the project cost. If not, the diagnostic is yours -- it's actionable either way.
>
> I have [X] spots open this month. Want me to get yours on the calendar?"

Then stop talking. The first person who speaks after the ask loses. Wait.

---

### Objection Handling Scripts

Every objection falls into one of five categories. Memorize the response framework for each.

#### "That's more than I expected."

They are comparing you to Squarespace ($16/month) or their nephew ($0).

> "I get it. And honestly, if all you need is a basic website that exists on the internet, there are way cheaper options. What I build is different -- it's a system designed to bring in customers. Let me ask you this: if your website brought in just 2 additional customers per month, what would that be worth to your business over a year?"

Let them do the math. A plumber with $500 average jobs says $12,000. A dentist with $2,000 new patient value says $48,000. Now your $10K project is obviously worth it.

> "So we're talking about a $10,000 investment to build a system that generates $[their math] per year. That pays for itself in [X] months and keeps generating returns after that."

#### "I need to think about it."

This is never about "thinking." It is about fear or a missing piece of information.

> "Of course. Can I ask -- what specifically would help you make the decision? Is it the investment amount, the timing, or something about the process?"

This surfaces the real objection. Common real objections hiding behind "let me think about it":

- **"I need to talk to my spouse/partner."** Response: "Totally understand. When do you think you'll talk? I'm happy to jump on a quick call with both of you if that would help."
- **"I'm not sure this is the right time."** Response: "What would make it the right time? Because here's the thing -- every month your website stays as-is, it's costing you roughly $[X] in lost business. Waiting 3 months costs you $[3X]. That's not a scare tactic -- it's the math we just calculated."
- **"I'm comparing other options."** Response: "Smart. What are you comparing against? I can help you think through what to look for." (This gives you intel on competitors and a chance to differentiate.)

#### "I already have a guy."

> "That's great -- having someone you trust is important. Out of curiosity, how long have you been working with them? And when was the last time they proactively came to you with a recommendation to improve something?"

Silence. 90% of the time, "my guy" is a developer who built the site 3 years ago and has not been heard from since. The question exposes the gap.

> "What I do is different from a developer who maintains your site. I look at the entire picture -- why your site isn't showing up on Google, why visitors aren't converting into calls, what your competitors are doing better. Think of it like a primary care doctor versus a specialist. Your developer is the generalist. I'm the person you see when something specific is wrong and you need a diagnosis."

#### "Can you do it for less?"

Never lower the price for the same scope. This trains the client to negotiate every time.

> "I can absolutely work within a tighter budget. Here's what I'd recommend at $[lower price]: [reduced scope]. You'd still get [core benefit], just without [specific extras we'd cut]. We can always add those later as a Phase 2 when budget allows.
>
> What I won't do is cut corners on quality. You've been burned by that before."

#### "What if it doesn't work?"

This is a trust question. They have been hurt.

> "Then we fix it. Here's my approach: I don't start by building. I start with the diagnostic -- a 48-hour deep dive where I analyze your site, your competitors, and your market before writing a single line of code. That way we know what we're building and why.
>
> I've done this 100+ times. Not templates -- real strategy for real businesses, including Fortune 500 companies. Everything I build belongs to you -- code, design, content, accounts. If you fire me tomorrow, you keep everything. No hostage situations.
>
> And the diagnostic itself comes with this guarantee: if you don't find at least 3 actionable insights you can implement immediately, I'll refund the full $750."

### Questions That Make Prospects Sell Themselves

These are the questions that shift the conversation from "you convincing them" to "them convincing themselves." Use them throughout the call:

1. **"What would it mean for your business if your website actually brought in 5 new customers per month?"** -- Forces them to envision the dream outcome.

2. **"How much do you think you're spending on your current website per year, including hosting, maintenance, and the time you personally spend dealing with it?"** -- Reveals hidden costs of the status quo.

3. **"If you could fix one thing about your online presence tomorrow, what would it be?"** -- They name their own priority. You now know exactly what to lead with.

4. **"What did the last web developer/agency you worked with get wrong?"** -- They tell you their objections before you even pitch. Now you can preemptively address them.

5. **"When you lose a customer to a competitor, where do you think they found that competitor?"** -- Makes them realize the answer is Google/online/the competitor's website.

6. **"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that your website is bringing in as many customers as it could?"** -- Nobody says 10. Whatever they say, follow up with: "What would it take to get it to a 9?"

## 4. Closing Mechanics: From Conversation to Cash

### The Proposal Format

Your proposal is not a document. It is a deal memo. Keep it to 1-2 pages. Business owners do not read 10-page proposals. They read the first page, skip to the price, and make a gut decision.

#### Structure (1-page format)

```
[NICE RIGHT LOGO]

GROWTH PLAN FOR [BUSINESS NAME]
Prepared for: [Name]
Date: [Date]

THE PROBLEM
[2-3 sentences recapping what you found. Use their words from the call.]
"Your website isn't showing up for '[keyword]' in [city], and
visitors who do find you are leaving because [specific issue].
This is costing you approximately $X/month in lost business."

THE SOLUTION
[3-5 bullet points of what you will build/fix]
- Redesigned website optimized for mobile and conversion
- Local SEO foundation (Google Business, schema, 10 key pages)
- Analytics setup so you can see what's working
- [Other specific deliverables based on their needs]

THE TIMELINE
- Week 1-2: Discovery + Design
- Week 3-5: Build + Revisions
- Week 6: Launch + Optimization

YOUR INVESTMENT
$[X,XXX]

Payment schedule:
- 40% at project start: $[X]
- 30% at design approval: $[X]
- 30% at launch: $[X]

[Or: 50/50 split for projects under $8,000]

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER LAUNCH
After your site goes live, I recommend a 90-day optimization
window where we monitor performance, adjust based on real data,
and make sure the results are tracking. That's what the Growth
Partnership is for -- $1,200-$2,000/month, no lock-in.

NEXT STEP
Reply "let's go" to this email and I'll send over the agreement
and first invoice. We can kick off as early as [date].

#### What NOT to include in the proposal

- Hourly rates. You sell outcomes, not hours.
- Technical jargon. No "React," "Next.js," "responsive breakpoints." They do not care.
- Multiple options. One recommendation. One price. If they want less, you can adjust on the phone.
- A long timeline for "reviewing the proposal." The proposal is an action document, not a study document.

### The Follow-Up Sequence After Sending the Proposal

Most deals are lost in the follow-up, not in the pitch. The proposal sits in their inbox while life gets in the way. Your follow-up is what keeps the deal alive.

| Day | Action | Message |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Day 0 | Send proposal | (The proposal itself) |
| Day 1 | Text or call | "Hey [Name], just sent over the growth plan. Let me know if anything needs clarification -- happy to jump on a quick call." |
| Day 3 | Email | "Hi [Name], wanted to check in on the proposal for [project]. Any questions I can answer? I have a spot opening up on [date] and want to make sure we can grab it if you're ready." |
| Day 7 | Email + value add | "Hi [Name], while working on another project in [their industry], I came across [relevant insight or article]. Thought it might be useful for [Business Name]. Also -- the proposal is still on the table. Let me know when you're ready to move forward." |
| Day 14 | Final touch | "Hey [Name] -- just wanted to close the loop on the growth plan for [Business Name]. I'm going to start filling Q2 spots soon. If this is something you want to do, now's the time. If the timing isn't right, no hard feelings -- I'll check in again in a few months." |

After Day 14, move them to a "nurture" list. Check in once per quarter with something valuable (not a sales pitch).

### How to Create Urgency Without Lying

You have no waitlist. You have no capacity constraints (yet). Do not manufacture fake scarcity. Here are urgency levers that are honest and effective:

1. **Founding rate expiration.** "I'm offering a founding rate to my first 5 clients -- $[X] instead of my standard $[higher X]. I've filled [N] of those 5 spots." This is real. You will raise prices. Set a date.

2. **Seasonal urgency.** "If your busy season starts in [month], we need to start now to have your new site ready before then." For HVAC: spring and fall. For restaurants: summer and holidays. For retail: Q4. This is genuinely true -- web projects take 6-8 weeks.

3. **Competitive urgency.** "I noticed [competitor] just launched a new website. They're going to start outranking you within 2-3 months. If we get started now, we can close the gap before they pull further ahead."

4. **Cost-of-delay math.** "Every month your website stays as-is, you're losing approximately $[X] in business. That's not a scare tactic -- it's the math we calculated together. Two months of delay costs you $[2X]."

5. **Calendar urgency.** "I block off project time in 4-week chunks. I have an opening starting [date]. The next one after that isn't until [later date]." This is real if you manage your calendar that way. Start doing so.

### Payment Structure

| Project Size | Structure | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Under $5,000 | 50% upfront, 50% at delivery | Simple. Low enough that split is easy. |
| $5,000-$10,000 | 40% start, 30% design approval, 30% launch | Milestone-based reduces perceived risk. Client only says "yes" to $3,000-$4,000 at a time, not the full amount. |
| Over $10,000 | 30% start, 30% midpoint, 40% launch | More milestones, more checkpoints, more trust-building moments. |
| Retainers | Monthly, due 1st of month, paid in advance | Standard retainer billing. Invoice goes out on the 25th, due on the 1st. |

**Payment methods:** Stripe (invoicing built in), or a simple invoice via QuickBooks/FreshBooks/Wave with a "Pay Now" link. ACH or credit card. Do not accept checks -- they bounce and they are slow.

**Deposit to start:** Always collect a deposit before starting work. No exceptions. "I don't start until the first payment clears" is a professional boundary, not a negotiation tactic.

### Contract or No Contract?

**Use a lightweight agreement, not a 15-page contract.** SMB owners are terrified of contracts. They associate contracts with agencies that locked them in for 12 months and delivered nothing.

Your agreement should be 1-2 pages and cover:

1. **Scope of work** (what you are building -- reference the proposal)
2. **Timeline** (estimated delivery dates)
3. **Payment terms** (amounts, schedule, method)
4. **Ownership** (they own everything you build -- code, design, content, accounts)
5. **Revisions** (what is included, what costs extra -- usually 2 rounds of revisions included)
6. **Termination** (either party can end the engagement with 7 days written notice; client pays for work completed to date)
7. **Confidentiality** (you will not share their business information)

Title it "Project Agreement" or "Working Agreement." Not "Contract." Not "Terms and Conditions." Not "Master Services Agreement." The word "agreement" implies collaboration. The word "contract" implies lawyers.

## 5. The Referral Engine

Referrals are the highest-converting, lowest-cost lead source. A referred prospect closes at 50-70% vs. 10-25% for cold outreach. The problem: most people ask for referrals wrong, or they do not ask at all.

### Rule 1: Ask Every Single Client

Every client. Including family. Including founding clients. Including the $750 diagnostic client. Every person who pays you money gets asked for a referral. Not "if you know anyone," which is vague and unmemorable. A specific ask.

### The Referral Ask Script (after delivering results)

Timing: at the project handoff meeting, or during the first retainer check-in after they have seen results.

> "[Name], I'm really glad the project turned out well. I have a quick question. My business grows almost entirely through referrals from people I've worked with. Do you know any other business owners -- maybe someone in your industry, your BNI group, your neighborhood -- who has mentioned being frustrated with their website or their online presence? Even if they're just starting to think about it. I'd love an introduction."

This works because:
- It is specific ("business owners who mentioned being frustrated with their website")
- It triggers memory recall (people remember complaints, not vague needs)
- It is low-commitment ("even if they're just starting to think about it")
- It gives the client a clear action ("an introduction")

### The Referral Ask Script (for people who are NOT clients)

For professional contacts, friends, and family who know what you do:

> "Hey [Name] -- quick question. I'm building my practice and most of my best clients come from introductions. You probably talk to a lot of business owners. If anyone ever mentions that their website isn't bringing in customers, or that they're losing business to a competitor who's more visible online -- would you think of me? I'll take great care of anyone you send my way."

### Turn Every Client Into a Referral Source (the system)

| Touchpoint | Action | Referral Ask |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Project kickoff | -- | None (too early) |
| Mid-project check-in | Show progress, build excitement | "If you're happy with how this is going, I'd love it if you kept me in mind for anyone else who might need help." |
| Project delivery | Deliver results, celebrate | Full referral ask (script above) |
| 30 days post-launch | Share early results data | "Results are looking great. Know anyone else who'd want this?" |
| 90 days post-launch | Share 90-day results | Full referral ask + testimonial request |
| Every retainer check-in | Share monthly results | "Any business owner friends asking about their website lately?" |

### Referral Incentives That Work

| Incentive | When to Use | How |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **No incentive (just goodwill)** | For clients who genuinely love your work | The ask alone is enough. Most people refer because they want to help a friend, not because they want a reward. |
| **$200-$500 referral fee** | For referral partners (accountants, coaches, agencies) | "For every referral that becomes a paying client, I send you $[X]. No strings, no tracking hassles." |
| **Free month of retainer** | For existing retainer clients | "Refer a business owner who signs a project, and your next month of Growth Partnership is on me." |
| **Reciprocal referrals** | For professionals in complementary fields | "I'll send you anyone who needs [their service]. You send me anyone who needs web/digital help." |

### Strategic Referral Partnerships

These are not one-time asks. These are ongoing relationships with professionals who talk to your ideal client every day.

**The best referral partners for a web/digital consultant:**

| Partner Type | Why They're Perfect | How to Approach |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Accountants / bookkeepers** | They see every client's revenue. They know who needs growth help. They talk to business owners about investing in the business. | "I help your clients make more money, which means they have more money to manage. Let's help each other." |
| **Business coaches / consultants** | Their clients need tactical execution on the strategies they recommend. | "You do the strategy. I build the digital execution. Together we're more valuable than either alone." |
| **Marketing agencies that don't do web** | Branding agencies, PR firms, social media agencies -- their clients all need websites they do not build. | "I'll do the web build under your brand or as a recommended partner. You keep the client relationship." |
| **Commercial real estate agents** | Every new business that signs a lease needs a website. | "When your new tenant opens their doors, they'll need a digital presence. I can be part of your recommended vendor list." |
| **Insurance agents** | They talk to every small business owner in town. | "When your clients mention business challenges, I'm the person to call for the digital side." |
| **Sign shops and print companies** | They serve the same local businesses you want. Every business getting a new sign also needs a new website. | Natural cross-referral relationship. |

**How to build these relationships:**

1. Identify 10 potential partners in your area.
2. Send a personal outreach (email or LinkedIn).
3. Offer coffee or lunch (you pay).
4. At the meeting: explain what you do, who your ideal client is, what happens when they refer someone (you will take great care of them and keep the partner informed).
5. Offer reciprocal referrals.
6. If appropriate, offer a referral fee ($200-$500 per converted referral).
7. Follow up monthly: "Hey, how's business? Just wanted to let you know I have capacity for new projects right now."

**Revenue goal from referral partners:** If 3 partners each send 1 referral per quarter, and 50% convert, that is 6 new clients per year from a channel that costs you lunch once per quarter.

## 6. The Math: Pipeline to $15K-$20K/Month

### The Funnel (Realistic Conversion Rates)

| Stage | Volume | Conversion to Next | Cumulative Conversion |
|-------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Outreach touches** (Loom, email, LinkedIn, networking) | 250/month | -- | -- |
| **Conversations started** (reply, connect, meet) | 25-35 (10-14%) | 10-14% | 10-14% |
| **Discovery calls booked** | 10-14 (40% of conversations) | 40% | 4-6% |
| **Proposals sent** | 7-10 (70% of calls are qualified) | 70% | 3-4% |
| **Deals closed** | 2-3 (25-33% of proposals) | 25-33% | 0.8-1.4% |

### Revenue Scenarios

#### Scenario A: All projects, no retainers (worst case structure)

| Closed Deals | Average Deal | Monthly Revenue |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2 deals/month | $6,000 avg (mix of diagnostics + small projects) | $12,000 |
| 3 deals/month | $6,000 avg | $18,000 |

This requires 250+ touches per month and consistent closing. Doable but exhausting with no revenue floor.

#### Scenario B: Projects + retainer base building (realistic)

| Month | Project Revenue | Retainer Revenue | Agency Subcontract | Total |
|-------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 | $1,500 (2 diagnostics + founding project deposit) | $0 | $0 | $1,500 |
| 2 | $5,000 (project delivery + diagnostic) | $0 | $2,000 | $7,000 |
| 3 | $6,000 (project + roadmap) | $0 | $4,000 | $10,000 |
| 4 | $7,000 (project + sprint) | $1,200 | $4,000 | $12,200 |
| 5 | $8,000 | $2,400 | $4,000 | $14,400 |
| 6 | $7,000 | $3,600 | $3,500 | $14,100 |
| 7 | $9,000 | $4,800 | $3,500 | $17,300 |
| 8 | $8,000 | $6,000 | $3,000 | $17,000 |
| 9 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $3,000 | $19,000 |

#### Scenario C: Aggressive (you nail outreach and close well)

| Month | Project Revenue | Retainer Revenue | Agency Subcontract | Total |
|-------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 | $3,000 (founding clients at discount) | $0 | $0 | $3,000 |
| 2 | $8,000 | $0 | $3,000 | $11,000 |
| 3 | $10,000 | $0 | $5,000 | $15,000 |
| 4 | $10,000 | $1,200 | $5,000 | $16,200 |
| 5 | $12,000 | $2,400 | $4,000 | $18,400 |
| 6 | $10,000 | $4,800 | $4,000 | $18,800 |

### Time From First Outreach to First Payment

| Milestone | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|
| First outreach sent | Day 1 |
| First conversation | Day 2-5 (warm network responds fast) |
| First discovery call | Day 5-10 |
| First proposal sent | Day 10-14 |
| First "yes" | Day 14-21 |
| First deposit collected | Day 14-25 |
| First project delivered | Day 40-60 |
| First full payment collected | Day 50-70 |

**From first outreach to first dollar in the bank: 2-4 weeks** (from warm network, faster if you do founding-rate diagnostics). Cold outreach takes 4-8 weeks.

### The Founding Client Strategy (Week 1-3)

Your first 3 clients serve a different function than your 10th client. They exist to:

1. Prove you can sell independently
2. Generate real testimonials
3. Create case studies you own completely
4. Build confidence
5. Generate cash flow while the pipeline matures

**The offer:**

> "I'm launching my independent practice and I'm looking for 3 founding clients. The deal: you get my full expertise -- 13 years, Fortune 500 portfolio -- at 40% off my standard rate. In return, I get a case study and testimonial. It's a fair trade, and these spots won't exist after the first 3 are filled."

**Founding client pricing:**
- Diagnostic: $500 (standard will be $750)
- Project: $5,000-$7,500 (standard will be $7,500-$15,000)
- Retainer: $800/month (standard will be $1,200+)

This is not discounting. This is a strategic trade: margin for speed-to-market-validation. After 3 founding clients, prices go to standard and stay there.

### 90-Day Revenue Ramp Projection

| Quarter | Revenue Range | Monthly Average |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Month 1-3 | $15,000-$30,000 | $5,000-$10,000 |
| Month 4-6 | $36,000-$55,000 | $12,000-$18,000 |
| Month 7-9 | $45,000-$60,000 | $15,000-$20,000 |
| Month 10-12 | $50,000-$70,000 | $17,000-$23,000 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$146,000-$215,000** | **$12,000-$18,000** |

**The $15K/month target is realistic by Month 5-7.** Not every month will hit it -- project revenue is lumpy. But the combination of projects + retainers + agency subcontracting should average above $15K from Month 6 onward.

**If your leading indicators (touches, conversations, calls) are on target but revenue is lagging:** the problem is in your sales conversation or your offer. Revisit the pitch.

**If your leading indicators are below target:** the problem is effort and consistency. That is a discipline problem, not a strategy problem. Do the touches.

### The Daily Routine (Months 1-6)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 8:00-8:30 | Research prospects for today's Looms (pull up sites, note issues) |
| 8:30-9:30 | Record and send 4 Loom videos |
| 9:30-10:00 | LinkedIn: send connections, value DMs, comment on posts |
| 10:00-10:15 | Send follow-ups (Day 3 and Day 10 on previous Looms, proposal follow-ups) |
| 10:15-10:30 | Cold email: review responses, send new batches (after Month 1) |
| 10:30-12:30 | Client work / project delivery |
| 12:30-1:30 | Lunch + admin (invoices, contracts, scheduling) |
| 1:30-4:30 | Client work / discovery calls (schedule calls at 2pm or 3pm slots) |
| 4:30-5:00 | CRM updates, Friday scorecard, weekly planning (Friday only) |

**The morning sales block (8:00-10:30) is sacred.** Do not skip it. Do not move it. Do not replace it with client work. The temptation to "just finish this one thing first" is how outreach dies and your pipeline dries up 60 days later. Client work is important. Sales work is survival.

## Summary: The One Thing That Matters

You have the skills. You have the experience. You have the portfolio. You have the results. You have a live website with case studies and testimonials.

None of that matters without conversations.

The only thing between you and $15K/month is 200 conversations per month with people who might need your help. Not 200 emails sent into the void. 200 conversations -- meaning a human being on the other side engaged with what you are saying.

Start having them. Today. Not after you tweak the website. Not after you finalize the pricing. Not after you read one more book about positioning. Today.

Send 10 messages to people you know. Record 2 Loom videos for businesses you do not know. That is 2 hours of work. By the end of this week, you will have more sales activity than you have had in the entire life of Nice Right.

The math works. The strategy works. The scripts work. But only if you execute them with the same discipline and consistency you bring to building a website. Every day. No exceptions.

The pipeline is not going to fill itself. Go fill it.
