# Offer Clarity Research: "What IS the Offer?"

Deep analysis of the Nice Right pricing section. Why even the seller cannot articulate what he is selling, and what to do about it.

---

## 1. The Clarity Problem -- Diagnosis

The reason Marcin looked at his own pricing section and could not articulate the offer is not because the copy is bad. The copy is well-written. The problem is structural: **there is no single offer. There are four separate products wearing a trench coat pretending to be one business.**

Here is what the page actually presents:

1. A $500 one-time audit (standalone diagnostic product)
2. A $1,500 paid discovery engagement (lead-in to a project, with a credit mechanic)
3. A $5K--$15K custom build (the actual core service)
4. An $800--$2,500/mo retainer (ongoing relationship, mentioned as a footnote)

These are four fundamentally different business models:
- Product 1 is a **productized service** (fixed scope, fixed price, fixed timeline).
- Product 2 is a **paid diagnostic / lead qualifier** (consulting engagement that functions as a sales mechanism).
- Product 3 is **custom project work** (the thing most visitors probably came for).
- Product 4 is a **retainer / fractional relationship** (recurring revenue, completely different buyer psychology).

**The core confusion:** The page does not decide whether Marcin is selling audits, strategy, websites, or an ongoing relationship. It presents all four as if the visitor should browse and pick. But the visitor does not know enough to pick. They came with a problem ("my website is not working" or "I need a new website") and they need to be told what happens next -- not handed a catalog.

### The Three Conflicting Frames

The page toggles between three incompatible frames:

**Frame A -- Consultant:** "I will diagnose your problem and tell you what to do." (Growth Audit, Conversion Audit)
**Frame B -- Builder:** "I will design and build your website/app/system." (Build & Launch)
**Frame C -- Partner:** "I will be your ongoing digital team." (Growth Partnership)

A single page can hold one frame comfortably, two if they are sequential (diagnose then build). Three creates identity confusion. The visitor cannot build a mental model of who this person is and what working with him actually looks like.

### What the Visitor Is Actually Thinking

An SMB owner lands on this page. They are thinking one of two things:

- "I need a new website" (or app, or system)
- "My current website is not getting me customers"

They are NOT thinking: "Let me evaluate whether I need a $500 audit, a $1,500 audit, a $5K--$15K build, or an $800/mo retainer." That is Marcin's internal product ladder. It is not the visitor's mental model.

---

## 2. What Is Actually Being Sold?

Strip away the tiers. Ignore the pricing structure. Look at the entire page -- hero, problem section, about, case studies, testimonials, FAQ -- and ask: what is the single transformation this person delivers?

**The transformation is this:** "Your digital presence goes from costing you customers to bringing them in."

Or more precisely: **Marcin finds out where your business is losing customers online, then fixes it -- so your website, app, or digital tools start generating leads, saving time, and keeping customers instead of losing them.**

That is the offer. Everything else is implementation detail.

### The One-Sentence Offer

> "I find out exactly where your business is losing customers online, then I build what fixes it."

This sentence contains the diagnosis (Growth Audit), the build (custom project), and the implied ongoing relationship -- without fragmenting them into separate products.

### How the Best Consultants Frame This

**Blair Enns (Win Without Pitching):** Position yourself as the expert who diagnoses and prescribes. The client is not buying deliverables; they are buying your ability to identify and solve their specific problem. Pricing should reflect value created, not hours spent.

**Jonathan Stark (Hourly Billing Is Nuts):** Present proposals with tiered options (good/better/best), but these are options within ONE engagement -- not separate products. The client has already decided to work with you. The tiers are about scope, not about whether to buy.

**Alex Hormozi ($100M Offers):** A Grand Slam Offer combines "an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee." The goal is to create a category of one -- something that cannot be compared to competitors. The current pricing section does the opposite: it looks like every other freelance pricing page on the internet.

**Brennan Dunn (Double Your Freelancing):** Price based on value, not deliverables. Lead with the business outcome, not the technical output. A "$5K--$15K website" is a commodity. "A digital presence that generates 12x more leads" is not.

---

## 3. The "Menu" Anti-Pattern

The current pricing section is structured like a SaaS pricing page: three cards, three price points, three CTAs. This works for software where the product is the same and the tiers differ by usage limits or features. It does not work for custom services.

### Why It Fails for Services

**SaaS tiers** differ by quantity (how many users, how much storage). The buyer can self-select because they know their own usage.

**Service tiers** differ by scope and complexity, which the buyer does not understand yet. The visitor does not know if they need a Conversion Audit or a Growth Audit because they do not know what is wrong with their business. That is literally what they are hiring Marcin to figure out.

Asking the visitor to self-select their tier is asking them to diagnose themselves before they have seen the doctor. It is backwards.

### The Research

- Columbia Business School: customers faced with too many choices are **10x less likely to purchase.**
- ConversionXL: pricing pages with clear value propositions per tier had **36% higher conversion rates** than those with ambiguous differentiation.
- ProfitWell: three-tier companies show **30% higher lifetime value** than those with five or more tiers.
- Simon-Kucher & Partners: only **15--20% of features significantly influence buying decisions** -- the rest is noise.

The current section has four products (three cards plus a footnote retainer), three different CTAs, two different audit names, a credit mechanic that requires explanation, and a price range ($5K--$15K) that itself spans 3x. That is a lot of cognitive load for an SMB owner who just wants to know: "Can this guy help me, and what does it cost?"

### How High-Converting Service Pages Handle This

The best solo consultants and small agencies do one of the following:

**Option A -- Single Offer, Single CTA:** One description of the engagement, one price (or "starting at"), one button ("Book a Call" or "Apply"). Everything else is handled in conversation. Examples: most high-ticket consultants, coaches, and boutique agencies.

**Option B -- Process-Based Presentation:** Instead of tiers, show the PROCESS. Step 1: We diagnose. Step 2: We build. Step 3: We optimize. Pricing is mentioned as a range or "starting at" figure, with a single CTA to start the conversation. The visitor understands the journey without having to pick a product.

**Option C -- Quiz / Assessment:** "Not sure what you need? Answer 3 questions and I will tell you." This moves the diagnostic burden from the visitor to the system, qualifying leads while making the visitor feel guided rather than abandoned in a menu.

## 4. Headline and Framing Analysis

### Current Headlines

- Section label: "Your Investment"
- H2: "Transparent pricing. Start where it makes sense for you."
- V2 (paragraph version) H2: "Start with clarity, not a contract."

### Problems

**"Your Investment"** -- This is a euphemism for "price." Everyone knows this. It does not create desire or curiosity. It is not bad, but it is wallpaper. The visitor does not feel anything when they read it.

**"Transparent pricing"** -- This is a trust signal, not a headline. It belongs in a footnote or a reassurance line, not as the primary framing of the section. It says "I will not rip you off" when it should be saying "here is what you get and why it is worth it."

**"Start where it makes sense for you"** -- This sounds accommodating but it is actually the source of the confusion. It tells the visitor "figure out your own starting point." The visitor does not want to figure out their starting point. They want to be told: "Here is what happens next."

**"Start with clarity, not a contract"** -- This is better. "Clarity" is a benefit. But it still frames the section around the buying process rather than the outcome. The visitor is not excited about clarity. They are excited about getting more customers.

### What High-Converting Service Pages Use Instead

Strong pricing headlines focus on outcomes or transformations:

- "Here is what it costs to stop losing customers online"
- "Your business, finally working for you -- not the other way around"
- "One engagement. Real results. No surprises."
- "The fastest path from 'my website does nothing' to 'where are all these leads coming from'"

Or they skip the "pricing" framing entirely and integrate the cost into a narrative about the engagement:

- "How we work together" (with pricing embedded in the process description)
- "What a typical engagement looks like" (normalizes the cost by wrapping it in context)

---

## 5. Feature vs. Outcome Copy -- Bullet Rewrite

### Current Bullets (Features)

**Conversion Audit ($500):**
- Full review of your current website
- Prioritized list of high-impact fixes
- Delivered within 48 hours
- Actionable -- use it yourself or hire me to implement

**Growth Audit ($1,500):**
- Deep-dive into your business & competitors
- Custom digital growth roadmap
- Clear scope, timeline & budget for your project
- Yours to keep -- even if you choose a different path

**Build & Launch ($5K--$15K):**
- Full website, app, or system -- designed and built
- Strategy-first approach based on your Growth Audit
- Regular check-ins so you always know where things stand
- Post-launch review to measure real results

### The Problem

Every bullet describes what Marcin DOES, not what the client GETS. "Full review of your current website" -- so what? "Deep-dive into your business & competitors" -- why should I care? The visitor is thinking about their business outcomes, not about Marcin's process.

### Rewritten as Outcomes

**Conversion Audit ($500):**
- Know exactly why your website is not converting visitors into customers
- A ranked list of fixes that will have the biggest impact on your revenue
- In your hands within 48 hours -- act on it immediately
- Works whether you implement it yourself, hire me, or hire someone else

**Growth Audit ($1,500):**
- See the specific opportunities your competitors are exploiting that you are missing
- A concrete plan showing where to invest your next dollar for maximum return
- Know exactly what your project will cost, how long it will take, and what results to expect
- Yours forever -- this is not a sales pitch, it is a business asset

**Build & Launch ($5K--$15K):**
- A digital presence that generates leads, saves time, or keeps customers -- built and launched
- Every decision grounded in real data about your business and your market
- You see progress every week and shape the direction -- no black-box surprises
- After launch, we measure real results together and adjust what needs it

### The Pattern

Every outcome bullet follows this structure: **[What changes for YOUR business] + [why that matters to you]**. The word "you" or "your" appears in every bullet. The word "I" does not appear at all.

---

## 6. The "Best For" Labels

### Current Labels

- "Best for: quick wins on your existing site"
- "Best for: knowing exactly where to invest"
- "Best for: a complete digital presence"

### Are These Helping?

No. They are creating a false segmentation that does not match how visitors think about their own problems.

**What the visitor is actually thinking:**

When they read "Best for: quick wins on your existing site" -- they think: "Is that what I need? I do not know. Maybe my site needs quick wins. Or maybe it needs to be rebuilt. How would I know?"

When they read "Best for: knowing exactly where to invest" -- they think: "I mean, yes, I want to know where to invest. But I also want a website. Is this an either/or? Do I need both?"

When they read "Best for: a complete digital presence" -- they think: "That sounds like what I need. But it says $5K--$15K. Can I afford that? Maybe I should start with the audit. But which audit?"

The labels send the visitor into a decision tree inside their own head. This is the opposite of what you want. You want the visitor to think: "I should talk to this person." Not: "I should figure out which of these four products I need."

### What Would Work Better

If tiers must exist, segment by **situation**, not by product:

- "I have a website but it is not getting me customers" --> Conversion Audit
- "I am not sure what I need -- I just know something needs to change" --> Growth Audit
- "I know what I need and I am ready to build" --> Build & Launch

Or, better: remove the self-selection entirely. One CTA: "Tell me about your business." Marcin handles the routing in the conversation.

---

## 7. CTA Analysis

### Current CTAs

- Card 1: "Get Your Audit"
- Card 2: "Book Your Growth Audit"
- Card 3: "Start a Conversation"

All three point to the same #contact section.

### The Problem

Three different CTAs for three different products, but they all go to the same place. This means the differentiation is fake. The visitor is going to have a conversation with Marcin regardless of which button they click. So why make them choose?

Furthermore, the CTAs have different levels of commitment:
- "Get Your Audit" sounds like you are buying something right now.
- "Book Your Growth Audit" sounds like scheduling an appointment for a specific service.
- "Start a Conversation" sounds low-commitment and exploratory.

The visitor who is not sure which tier they need (most visitors) will gravitate toward "Start a Conversation" because it is the lowest risk. But that CTA is on the most expensive tier, which creates a weird mismatch.

### What CTA Research Says

- Personalized CTAs perform **202% better** than generic ones (HubSpot).
- Pages with a **single clear CTA** convert significantly better than those with multiple competing CTAs.
- The best CTAs for service businesses start with a verb and name the outcome: "Book Your Free Strategy Call," "Get Your Custom Growth Plan," "See What Is Possible."

### Recommendation

**One CTA, repeated throughout the section:** "Book Your Free Strategy Call" or "Find Out What Would Work for Your Business."

This is already the CTA in the hero section. The pricing section should reinforce it, not introduce three new ones. The visitor should leave the pricing section thinking: "I need to talk to this person." Not: "I need to decide which product to buy."

---

## 8. The Footnote Problem

### What Is Buried

The following information is crammed into small text at the bottom of the pricing section:

1. **Growth Partnership ($800--$2,500/mo):** This is an entire business model -- recurring revenue, ongoing optimization, fractional-team positioning -- mentioned in a single sentence.
2. **"No lock-in contracts":** This is one of the strongest trust signals on the entire page.
3. **"I keep working with you because the results speak for themselves":** This is a powerful confidence statement.
4. **"Currently taking on 2 new projects per quarter":** This is scarcity. It is one of the most effective persuasion levers available.
5. **"Spots for Q2 2026 are open":** This is urgency. Combined with scarcity, this is high-converting copy.
6. **Agency comparison ("$15,000--$40,000 for the same scope"):** This is a value anchor that makes $5K--$15K feel like a bargain.

### Why This Matters

The most persuasive elements on the page are in the smallest font size. The pricing cards have the largest visual weight, but they contain the weakest copy (features). The footnotes have the smallest visual weight, but they contain the strongest copy (trust, scarcity, urgency, value anchoring).

This is exactly backwards.

### What Should Be Prominent

- **Scarcity + urgency** ("2 new projects per quarter / Q2 spots open") should be near the top of the section, not the bottom.
- **"No lock-in contracts"** should be a visual callout or badge, not a footnote.
- **The agency price comparison** should be positioned as a "why this is worth it" proof point, not an afterthought.
- **The Growth Partnership** either needs its own section or needs to be removed from the pricing section entirely. Mentioning a $2,500/mo retainer in a footnote devalues it.

## 9. Competitor Teardowns

### Approach 1: The "No Pricing Page" Consultant

**Pattern:** Many of the most successful solo web consultants (Nick Disabato / Draft, high-ticket Webflow studios, etc.) do not have pricing pages at all. They have a "Work With Me" or "How It Works" page that describes the engagement process, names a "starting at" figure or "typical range," and ends with a single CTA to apply or book a call.

**Why it works:** It positions the consultant as someone who solves problems on a case-by-case basis, not someone who sells products off a shelf. The pricing discussion happens in conversation, where the consultant can frame it relative to the client's specific situation and ROI.

**Relevance to Marcin:** This approach would work well. Marcin's projects range from $500 to $15K+ and involve different deliverables. A pricing page implies standardization that does not exist.

### Approach 2: The Productized Service (Brian Casel Model)

**Pattern:** One service, one price, one scope. "I will do X for $Y in Z weeks." No customization, no tiers, no discovery calls. The visitor knows exactly what they get and exactly what they pay. Examples: Design Pickle, ManyPixels, older versions of Draft Revise.

**Why it works:** Maximum clarity. Zero decision fatigue. The visitor either wants it or does not.

**Relevance to Marcin:** This only works if Marcin narrows to a single deliverable (e.g., "I build Webflow sites for service businesses, $7,500, 6 weeks"). His current range of services (websites, apps, systems, automation, retention) is too broad for pure productization.

### Approach 3: The Paid Discovery Funnel

**Pattern:** The only thing for sale on the website is the diagnostic. "$2,500 for a Growth Audit. Credited toward your project if we move forward." The build is not mentioned on the pricing page at all -- it is proposed after the audit, scoped specifically to the client's situation.

**Why it works:** It solves the self-selection problem. Every visitor, regardless of their situation, enters through the same door. The diagnostic reveals what they need, and the proposal that follows is custom. The credit mechanic makes it risk-free.

**Relevance to Marcin:** This is very close to what the page already describes. The Growth Audit IS the entry point. The problem is that the page presents it as one of three options instead of as THE path.

### Approach 4: The "Book a Call" Minimalist

**Pattern used by high-ticket consultants:** Hero section describes the transformation. Body provides proof (case studies, stats, testimonials). Single CTA: "Book a Call." No pricing section at all, or a one-line mention ("Engagements start at $X").

**Why it works:** Pricing is a conversation, not a page element. The page's job is to generate desire and trust, not to close the sale.

**Relevance to Marcin:** This is viable but may lose visitors who want pricing transparency before booking a call. Marcin's current audience (SMB owners) tends to be price-sensitive and wants to know ballpark numbers before getting on the phone.

### Approach 5: The Process-Based Pricing Narrative

**Pattern:** Instead of cards or tiers, pricing is presented as a story: "Here is how a typical engagement works. We start with X ($Y), then we do Z ($A), and if you want ongoing support, that is $B/mo." Pricing is woven into the narrative of the engagement.

**Why it works:** The visitor follows a journey instead of evaluating a menu. Each price point makes sense in context because it follows the previous step logically. There is no decision paralysis because the steps are sequential, not parallel.

**Relevance to Marcin:** The V2 homepage (paragraph version, currently live at `/`) already does this. And it does it well. The V3 page (card version at `/v3`) undoes this by switching to the menu format.

---

## 10. The One-Offer Reframe

If the entire pricing section had to be collapsed into ONE offer with ONE price and ONE CTA, here is the case for radical simplification.

### The Single Offer

**Name:** Digital Growth Audit

**Price:** $1,500 (credited in full toward your project)

**CTA:** "Book Your Growth Audit"

**What the visitor gets:**
- A deep-dive into your business, your competitors, and your digital presence
- A clear picture of where you are losing customers and where the opportunities are
- A concrete plan: what to build, what it will cost, what results to expect, and when
- If we move forward together, your $1,500 is applied toward the project (typical projects: $5K--$15K)
- If you go a different direction, the audit is yours -- a business asset you own

**What disappears:**
- The $500 Conversion Audit (offer it verbally on calls to people who clearly only need a quick fix, or as a downsell)
- The Build & Launch card (this is not a product to sell on a page -- it is the natural next step after the audit, proposed with custom scope)
- The Growth Partnership footnote (introduce this after the project is complete, when the client already trusts you)

### Why This Works

**One decision:** "Do I want to find out what is really going on with my business online?" Yes or no. That is it.

**Zero self-diagnosis:** The visitor does not need to know if they need an audit, a website, or a retainer. They just need to know they have a problem and Marcin can help find the answer.

**The credit mechanic becomes the hero:** "$1,500, but it is free if we work together" is an incredibly compelling risk reversal. Right now it is a bullet point in a card. It should be the centerpiece of the offer.

**Natural upsell path:** Audit leads to project proposal. Project leads to ongoing relationship. Each step earns trust and creates demand for the next. You do not need to sell all four products on one page because each sells the next.

**Hormozi's Value Equation applied:**
- Dream Outcome: "Know exactly what is wrong and exactly how to fix it" (high)
- Perceived Likelihood: "13 years, 100+ projects, real results with proof" (high)
- Time Delay: "Delivered in 2 weeks" (low)
- Effort & Sacrifice: "You just have a conversation with me. I do the work." (low)

This makes the offer feel like a no-brainer. $1,500 to get a comprehensive plan for growing your business online, from someone who has done it 100+ times, and it is free if you hire him? That is a Grand Slam Offer for the SMB market.

### The Rewritten Section

Here is what the pricing section could look like as a single offer:

---

**How We Start**

Every engagement begins the same way: with a Growth Audit.

I spend two weeks researching your business, your competitors, and your customers. I look at what is working, what is not, and where the real opportunities are. Then I give you a plan -- not a vague strategy deck, but a concrete roadmap: what to build, what it costs, what results to expect, and when.

**$1,500.** Credited in full toward your project if we move forward.

If we do not? The audit is yours. Use it with another developer, hand it to your team, or file it away. It is a business asset either way.

Most clients who start with a Growth Audit end up working with me. Not because they have to, but because by that point, they have seen the thinking -- and they want the person who did the diagnosis to do the surgery.

Typical projects: $5,000--$15,000. Timeline: 4--8 weeks.

**[Book Your Growth Audit]**

Only taking on 2 new projects per quarter. Q2 2026 spots are open.

No retainers. No lock-in. No surprises on the invoice.

---

### What the $500 Conversion Audit Becomes

It does not disappear -- it moves. Mention it on the call for people who clearly only need a tune-up. Or add a single line below the main offer: "Already have a site that just needs fixing? Ask me about the $500 Conversion Audit." This keeps it available without diluting the primary offer.

### What the Growth Partnership Becomes

It moves to a separate page ("Ongoing Support") or is introduced in post-project conversations. Trying to sell a monthly retainer to someone who has not even hired you yet is premature. Earn the trust first.
