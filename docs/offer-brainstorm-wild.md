# The Playbook Nobody Would Give You: 15 Unconventional Plays for Nice Right

**For:** Marcin Dabrowski / niceright.co
**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Tone:** Tim Ferriss meets Gary Halbert meets Noah Kagan. No fluff. Specific plays. Do them this week.

## BEFORE WE START: THE RAW MATERIAL

I went through the entire codebase -- every case study, every testimonial, every line of copy, all the prior research docs. Here is what most people would overlook that is actually weapons-grade:

1. **The 290% / 12x stat.** This is a nuclear warhead sitting in a closet. You have a case study where you increased traffic by 290% and leads by 12x. Right now it is a counter animation on your homepage. It should be the opening line of every cold email, every LinkedIn post, every conversation. This one number, properly deployed, is worth more than your entire portfolio combined.

2. **You built Northern Trust's animations.** Go to northerntrust.com right now. Scroll. Those micro-interactions? You built those. Every business owner in Cleveland has heard of Northern Trust. None of them know you made their website feel alive. That is a fixable problem.

3. **100+ projects is not a number. It is a database.** You have seen the inside of over 100 small businesses. You know their problems, their software, their vendor complaints, their revenue models. That is proprietary market intelligence. Nobody else in Cleveland has that dataset in their head.

4. **Sparkblox raised $1M and died.** Most people hide this. It is your best conversation starter. "I raised a million dollars, built a product, and it failed. Here is what I learned about what actually works." Every business owner respects someone who has lost money and kept going.

5. **Cleveland is a cheat code.** There are maybe 3-5 solo consultants in the Cleveland metro doing what you do at your level. In Austin or Miami there are 300. The competition is not the problem -- the visibility is.

6. **Your testimonials praise the WRONG THING (from a marketing perspective).** They praise your ability to translate, to understand, to go above and beyond. Nobody praises "he builds nice websites." They praise "he understood my business better than I did." That is a completely different product than what the site currently sells.

## SECTION 1: ATTENTION HACKS (Get Noticed With $0)

### IDEA 1: "Your Website Is Losing You $____/Month" -- The Uninvited Audit Video

**The idea:**
Every week, pick one Cleveland business. Pull up their website. Record a 5-minute Loom video doing a live diagnosis: here is what is broken, here is what it is costing them, here is exactly how to fix it. Be specific. Be generous. Name the dollar amount.

But here is the twist that makes it not just another Loom outreach: **post it publicly.** On LinkedIn. On YouTube. With the business name. Tag the owner if you can find them.

This is the Gary Halbert "A-pile" move. When a business owner sees their own name and their own website being analyzed on video, it goes to the top of the pile. Always. It is physically impossible to ignore someone talking about YOUR business on camera.

**The exact format:**
- Title: "[Business Name] Is Losing $3,200/Month From Their Website. Here Is Why."
- 0:00-0:30: "I drove past [Business Name] on [Street]. Great [product/service]. But their website is quietly killing them. Let me show you."
- 0:30-3:00: Screen share. Walk through 3 specific problems. Quantify each one.
- 3:00-4:30: "Here is what I would do. Step one... step two... step three."
- 4:30-5:00: "If you are a Cleveland business owner and you want me to do this for your site, drop your URL in the comments. I will pick one per week."

**Why it could work:**
- The business owner sees it and either (a) is flattered and reaches out, or (b) is motivated by slight embarrassment to fix the problem -- ideally with you
- Other business owners in the same niche watch and think "is MY site doing the same thing?"
- The comment section fills with business owners volunteering their URLs -- which is a self-qualifying lead list
- LinkedIn's algorithm rewards native video, especially content that tags people and generates comments
- Each video is a permanent portfolio piece that demonstrates expertise better than any case study page

**How to execute this week:**
1. Monday: Pick a Cleveland restaurant with a bad website. Record 5 minutes. Post on LinkedIn and YouTube.
2. Wednesday: Pick a Cleveland home service company. Same thing.
3. Friday: Pick a Cleveland professional services firm (dentist, accountant, lawyer). Same thing.
4. End each video with: "Want me to audit yours? Drop your URL below."
5. DM the business owner a link to the video with a short, non-salesy note: "Made this for you. No strings. Hope it is useful."

**Expected result:** 3-5 inbound conversations per week within 30 days. 500+ LinkedIn views per video if you are consistent (Cleveland business community is tight and shares aggressively). 1 paying client within 60 days from this channel alone.

**Risk level: LOW.** The only risk is that a business owner gets offended. Mitigate this by being genuinely helpful, not cruel. You are not roasting them. You are giving them free consulting on camera. Frame it as "I am impressed by your business and I think your website is not doing you justice."

### IDEA 2: The "I Rebuilt Your Website Over The Weekend" Stunt

**The idea:**
Pick one local business with a terrible website. Over a single weekend, design and build a complete replacement. Not a mockup. Not a wireframe. A real, functional, beautiful website. Deploy it to a staging URL.

Monday morning, walk into their business with your laptop. Show them. Say: "I built this for you. It is yours if you want it. If you like it, we can talk about what it would cost to make it permanent. If you do not like it, no hard feelings."

Then -- whether they buy it or not -- document the entire process. Time-lapse the build. Show the before/after. Post it everywhere.

**Why it could work:**
- This is the Noah Kagan "just do the thing" approach. Instead of selling the idea of a website, you hand them a finished website. The psychological distance between "should I hire someone?" and "should I keep this thing that already exists?" is enormous. The second question is 10x easier to say yes to.
- The documentation becomes viral content: "I rebuilt a [restaurant/plumber/dentist]'s entire website in 48 hours. Here is the before and after." People LOVE before/after content. It is the most shared format on every platform.
- Even if the business does not buy it, every other business owner who sees the content thinks: "He could do that for me in a weekend?"
- It demonstrates your speed, which is your actual superpower with AI leverage. Agencies take 3 months. You take 48 hours. That speed gap is the story.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Thursday evening: Pick a Cleveland business. Ideally one you have some connection to, or one whose owner you can reach by phone/email. A restaurant is perfect -- everyone understands what a restaurant website should look like.
2. Friday night through Sunday: Build the site. Use your real stack (Next.js, Vercel). Make it genuinely great -- not a template slap. 5-7 pages. Real copy. Real SEO. Mobile-perfect.
3. Monday: Walk in (during a slow hour, like Tuesday at 2pm). Show them on your laptop. Leave a printed one-pager with the staging URL and your contact info.
4. Regardless of outcome: Write the LinkedIn post. Film the before/after reveal video. Post.

**Expected result:** The business has a 40-60% chance of converting (spec work has a surprisingly high close rate when it is genuinely good). Even if they do not buy, the content from the stunt generates 5-10 inbound conversations.

**Risk level: MEDIUM.** You are investing 15-20 hours of unpaid work. If the business says no AND the content does not perform, you are out a weekend. But the site becomes a portfolio piece regardless. The downside is bounded; the upside is unbounded.

### IDEA 3: The "State of Cleveland Business Websites" Annual Report

**The idea:**
Audit 50 Cleveland small business websites across 5 industries (restaurants, home services, professional services, retail, health/wellness). Score each one on 10 criteria: mobile speed, SEO basics, conversion elements, design quality, Google Business integration, etc. Compile the data into a free, public report.

Title: "The State of Cleveland Small Business Websites: 2026 Report"

Publish it as a beautiful PDF and a blog post on niceright.co. Send a press release to Cleveland.com, Crain's Cleveland Business, and every local business newsletter. Send individual scores to each of the 50 businesses: "You scored 4/10. Here is how to get to 8/10."

**Why it could work:**
- Local business media LOVES local data stories. "Cleveland small businesses are losing $X million per year to bad websites" is a headline that writes itself. Getting picked up by one local outlet puts you in front of every business owner who reads it.
- 50 audited businesses = 50 warm leads who have a specific score and a reason to talk to you
- The report establishes you as THE authority on small business digital presence in Cleveland. Nobody else has done this. The first person to do it owns the category.
- It is a lead magnet that actually provides value. "Download the free report" in exchange for an email address = the beginning of your email list.
- It is replicable. Do it annually. Year 2 you can show trends. Year 3 you are the definitive source.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Build the scoring rubric (10 criteria, 1-10 scale each). Do this in 30 minutes. It does not need to be peer-reviewed. It needs to be logical and consistent.
2. Start auditing. 10 per day = 5 days = 50 businesses. Each audit takes 10-15 minutes with the right tools (PageSpeed Insights, Ahrefs free tier, manual mobile check, basic SEO scan).
3. Compile into a clean PDF. Use your design skills -- make it look like a real research report, not a blog post. Include charts, industry breakdowns, and an "average score by industry" comparison.
4. Publish in 2 weeks. Send personalized emails to all 50 businesses with their individual score. Send the press release to 5 local media outlets.

**Expected result:** 10-15 inbound conversations from the 50 audited businesses. 1-2 media mentions. 200+ email list signups from the gated PDF. Position as Cleveland's de facto small business web authority.

**Risk level: LOW.** Time investment of ~20 hours spread over 2 weeks. No financial cost. Worst case: nobody picks it up and you have 50 warm leads and a great content piece for the site.

## SECTION 2: OFFERS NOBODY ELSE IS MAKING

### IDEA 4: The "Website in a Week, Pay After You See It" Guarantee

**The idea:**
Here is the offer: "I will build your complete website in 5 business days. You pay nothing upfront. At the end of the week, I show you the finished site. If you love it, you pay $5,000. If you do not love it, you owe nothing. Walk away."

This is the Gary Halbert "risk reversal so aggressive it sounds insane" play. The entire risk is on Marcin. The business owner has literally nothing to lose.

**Why it could work:**
- It eliminates the #1 objection in the SMB web market: "What if I pay and it sucks?" The answer is: you do not pay.
- It is so unusual that it becomes the talking point. "You will not BELIEVE what this guy offered me." Word of mouth spreads.
- The speed (5 days) is itself a differentiator. Agencies take 8-12 weeks. Even fast freelancers take 3-4 weeks. Five business days is shocking. It makes people say: "Wait, really?"
- The close rate should be extremely high. If the site is good (and it will be, because you have built 100+), nobody walks away from a finished website they love. The "pay after" model converts better than "pay before" by 30-50% based on every study of risk-reversal pricing.
- AI leverage is what makes this possible. You can build in 5 days what used to take 5 weeks. The speed is real. Monetize it.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Write the offer as a single landing page on niceright.co/week. Copy: "Your website, built in 5 business days. Pay nothing until you see the finished product. $5,000 if you love it. $0 if you do not."
2. Add 3 constraints to protect yourself: (a) 5-7 pages max, (b) client provides photos/logo by day 1, (c) one round of revisions included, additional revisions at $150/hour
3. Send the link to 10 warm contacts with: "I am testing a new offer. Would any business owners you know be interested in this?"
4. Post the offer on LinkedIn with the framing: "I am doing something my accountant thinks is insane."

**Expected result:** 3-5 serious inquiries within 2 weeks. Close 2 of them. Revenue: $10,000. More importantly: 2 case studies and 2 testimonials that you can use to sell the offer at $7,500, then $10,000.

**Risk level: MEDIUM.** The risk is building a site and having the client walk away. Mitigate by qualifying carefully (do they have budget? do they have a real business?). Even in the worst case, you have a portfolio piece.

---

### IDEA 5: The "$100/Day Website" Subscription

**The idea:**
Instead of a $5,000 project, offer a website as a monthly subscription: $3,000/month for 3 months, then $300/month ongoing. The business gets: a professional website (designed and built in week 1), hosting, maintenance, updates, monthly analytics report, and 2 hours of changes/month.

The pitch: "Your website costs less per day than your coffee budget. $100/day for the first 90 days. $10/day after that. No contract. Cancel anytime."

**Why it could work:**
- $3,000/month for 3 months = $9,000 total for the build phase. That is more than the $5,000 sprint, but paid in installments that feel smaller. Then $300/month is pure recurring revenue.
- "Cancel anytime" sounds generous but the churn is extremely low. Switching website providers is a massive pain. Once someone is on your system, they stay. Industry data says managed website services have 85-95% annual retention.
- The $100/day framing is genius because it anchors to a daily cost, not a lump sum. Every business owner spends $100/day on something frivolous. This reframes the website as a daily business expense, like rent or payroll, not a scary capital expenditure.
- At 20 clients on the $300/month maintenance tier: $6,000/month in MRR = $72,000/year in recurring revenue before you take on a single new project. That is the floor that lets you be selective about project work.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Create the offer page. Frame it around the daily cost: "$100/day for 90 days. $10/day after that."
2. Target businesses that are currently paying $50-$200/month for garbage hosting (GoDaddy website builder, cheap WordPress themes with paid plugins they do not use). Show them: "You are already paying $X/month for something that does not work. Pay a bit more and get something that does."
3. Approach 5 businesses with: "What are you paying for your website right now, monthly?" Many will say $50-$150. Then: "For $150 more per month, you could have a real website built by someone who did Northern Trust."

**Expected result:** 2-3 subscribers in the first month. $6,000-$9,000 in month 1 revenue. Growing to 15-20 subscribers over 6 months = ~$5,000/month floor.

**Risk level: LOW.** The subscription model is proven across every industry. The only risk is churn, mitigated by making the sites genuinely good and the switching cost high (you own the hosting).

---

### IDEA 6: The "I Will 3X Your Leads or You Do Not Pay" Performance Deal

**The idea:**
For businesses that already have a website generating SOME leads (even if it is 5/month), make this offer: "I will redesign your site to 3x your monthly leads within 90 days. If I do not hit 3x, you pay nothing. If I do, you pay $15,000."

This is not a rev-share (too complex) and not a guarantee (too vague). It is a performance bet with a specific, measurable target and a binary outcome.

**Why it could work:**
- You have the 12x leads case study. Tripling leads is conservative based on your track record. You are not gambling -- you are playing with a stacked deck.
- The business owner's risk is zero. The only risk is your time.
- The price ($15,000) is 2-3x your normal rate, which is justified because YOU are bearing all the risk. Performance pricing should always be premium pricing.
- If you hit 3x for even one client, that case study is the most powerful sales tool you could possibly create: "I tripled [Business Name]'s leads in 90 days. They paid me $15,000. Their ROI was [massive number]."

**How to execute this week:**
1. Identify 3-5 businesses with trackable lead volume (form submissions, phone calls via CallRail, booking requests). Ideally businesses doing 10-30 leads/month so that 3x (30-90) is achievable.
2. Approach each one with: "I think I can triple your monthly leads within 90 days. If I do, you pay $15,000. If I do not, you pay nothing. Want to try?"
3. Set up tracking infrastructure before starting (Google Analytics goals, call tracking, form submission logging). The tracking must be bulletproof so there is no argument about the numbers.

**Expected result:** 1-2 businesses say yes (the offer is absurdly good from their perspective). You deliver for at least 1 of them. Revenue: $15,000. Case study value: priceless.

**Risk level: HIGH.** If you miss 3x, you worked for free. Mitigate by cherry-picking businesses with obvious, fixable problems (sites that are clearly leaving money on the table). If the current site is a GoDaddy template with no mobile optimization and no calls-to-action, tripling leads is almost trivially achievable for someone with your skills.

## SECTION 3: LEAD GENERATION STUNTS

### IDEA 7: The Free Tool -- "How Much Is Your Website Costing You?" Calculator

**The idea:**
Build a simple web tool on niceright.co/calculator. The business owner enters: their industry, their city, their average customer value, and their website URL. The tool runs a quick automated audit (PageSpeed, mobile check, basic SEO) and spits out: "Your website is likely costing you $X,000/year in lost customers. Here is why." Then: "Want a detailed breakdown? Enter your email."

This is the lead magnet that markets itself. Nobody can resist entering their own URL into a tool that tells them how much money they are losing.

**Why it could work:**
- Interactive tools get shared 10x more than static content. A business owner who uses the calculator sends it to their business owner friend: "Put in your URL. See what it says."
- It captures emails at the point of maximum curiosity (right after they see the scary number)
- It pre-qualifies leads: if someone's site scores poorly, they are a hot lead. If their site scores well, you saved yourself a call.
- It demonstrates technical ability without saying a word about it. The tool itself IS the portfolio piece.
- It runs 24/7, generating leads while you sleep

**How to execute this week:**
1. Build an MVP in 2-3 days. Use the PageSpeed Insights API, a basic SEO check (does the site have meta descriptions? is it mobile responsive? does it have schema markup?), and some industry benchmarks.
2. The "cost" calculation does not need to be exact. Use conservative industry averages: "Businesses in your industry with similar issues lose approximately $X-$Y per month in potential customers." Cite sources.
3. Deploy to niceright.co/calculator. Gate the detailed report behind an email.
4. Share the calculator in every Cleveland business Facebook group, every Chamber of Commerce newsletter, every LinkedIn post.

**Expected result:** 50-100 email captures per month once the tool gets traction. 5-10 warm leads per month (people whose sites scored badly and who want help). The tool becomes a permanent lead generation asset.

**Risk level: LOW.** Build cost is 15-20 hours of your time. No ongoing cost. If it does not work, it sits on your site as a credibility piece.

---

### IDEA 8: The "Cleveland Website Hall of Shame (and Fame)" Monthly Feature

**The idea:**
Publish a monthly blog post and LinkedIn article: "5 Cleveland Websites That Are Killing It (And 5 That Are Killing Their Business)." For each "fame" entry, explain what they are doing right. For each "shame" entry, explain what is going wrong and how to fix it. Do not be cruel -- be educational. Think Consumer Reports, not Mean Girls.

The twist: invite businesses to nominate themselves for review. "Think your website is great? Submit it. Think your website needs help? Submit it. We will feature the best and worst of Cleveland's online presence every month."

**Why it could work:**
- Lists are the most shared content format. "Top 10" and "Best/Worst" lists are engagement machines on every platform.
- The "Fame" businesses will share the article (free distribution from people with bigger audiences than you).
- The "Shame" businesses become leads (they now know they have a problem AND who can fix it).
- Self-nomination turns readers into participants. People who submit their URL are pre-qualified leads.
- Monthly cadence creates anticipation and a reason to follow/subscribe.
- It positions you as the arbiter of quality in the Cleveland market. You are the judge. That IS authority.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Audit 10 Cleveland business websites (5 good, 5 bad). Write 200-300 words on each.
2. Publish as a blog post on niceright.co and a LinkedIn article.
3. Tag all 10 businesses in the LinkedIn post.
4. End with: "Want your site reviewed next month? Drop your URL in the comments or email me."
5. Repeat monthly. By month 6, businesses will be submitting voluntarily.

**Expected result:** 2-3 inbound leads per month from "shame" businesses that want to fix their sites. 1-2 inbound leads from businesses that want to maintain their "fame" status. Steady LinkedIn engagement growth. A content archive that compounds.

**Risk level: LOW.** The only risk is offending a "shame" business. Mitigate by being constructive, not cruel. Frame it as "untapped potential" not "your website sucks."

---

### IDEA 9: The "Office Hours" Play -- Free Consulting, in Public

**The idea:**
Every Thursday from 12-1pm, host a free, public "Website Office Hours" session. Zoom link, posted publicly. Any Cleveland business owner can join. They share their screen, show their website, and Marcin gives them 10 minutes of live, honest feedback and specific action items.

No pitch. No upsell. Just free help, every week, forever.

**Why it could work:**
- This is the Tim Ferriss "give away the recipe, sell the restaurant" model. The advice is free. The execution is what costs money. Business owners who get free advice and realize "this is way more complex than I thought" become clients.
- It creates a weekly touchpoint with your target audience. People who attend week 1 bring a friend to week 2. The group grows.
- It generates content automatically. Record every session. Clip the best 5-minute segments. Post them as "Website Teardown" videos.
- It builds community. The regulars start referring each other to you. "Go to Marcin's Thursday office hours, he is incredible."
- It costs nothing except 1 hour/week of your time. And that hour IS your marketing.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Set up a recurring Zoom meeting. Publish the link on LinkedIn, on your site, in Cleveland Facebook groups.
2. Post: "Starting this Thursday: free website office hours. Any Cleveland business owner can jump on and get honest feedback on their website. No pitch, no BS, just help. Link: [URL]"
3. Week 1: even if 2 people show up, it works. Give them incredible value. They tell 3 friends each.
4. By week 4: you should have 8-15 attendees. That is a lead pipeline on autopilot.

**Expected result:** 1-2 paying clients per month from office hours attendees. A growing email list from signups. A weekly content engine. A reputation as the most generous consultant in Cleveland.

**Risk level: VERY LOW.** Worst case: nobody shows up and you have your Thursday lunch back. Best case: it becomes the engine that feeds everything else.

## SECTION 4: LEVERAGE PLAYS

### IDEA 10: The Accountant Alliance

**The idea:**
Every small business has an accountant. That accountant talks to 50-200 businesses. You talk to zero. The math is obvious: make the accountant your sales force.

Here is how: identify 10 accountants and bookkeepers in Cleveland who serve small businesses. Offer each one a deal: "For every client you refer who becomes a paying customer, I give you $500. No cap. No limit. And I will build YOUR firm's website for free as a demonstration of my work."

Build the accountant's website for free. Make it incredible. Now the accountant has:
1. A beautiful website (which their colleagues and clients see, driving more referrals)
2. A $500/pop incentive to send you business
3. A personal experience of working with you, so their referral is genuine

**Why it could work:**
- Accountants see every business's financials. They KNOW who is spending money on bad digital services. They can say: "I see you are paying [Agency] $2,000/month and your revenue has not moved. Talk to Marcin."
- The free website eliminates the accountant's risk. They are not referring a stranger. They are referring someone who built THEIR site.
- $500 per referral is meaningful to a small accounting firm. If they send you 10 clients a year, that is $5,000 in pure profit for making introductions.
- The accountant-to-SMB referral is the highest-trust channel that exists. When your accountant recommends someone, you listen.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Search "small business accountant Cleveland" on Google Maps. List the top 20.
2. Email or call 10 of them: "I am a web consultant who works with small businesses. I would like to build your firm's website for free, in exchange for the opportunity to be your go-to referral when clients need web help."
3. Target accountants whose own websites are bad (most of them are). The pitch is self-evident: "Your website needs work. Let me show you what I can do. If you like it, you will be confident recommending me to your clients."
4. Build the first accountant's site in a week. Use it as the case study for approaching accountant #2, 3, 4...

**Expected result:** 3-5 accountant partnerships within 60 days. Each accountant sends 1-2 referrals per quarter. At $500 referral fee + $5K-$10K per converted client, the math works by month 4.

**Risk level: LOW.** You invest 20-30 hours building free sites for accountants. Even if the referrals take 6 months to materialize, you have built relationships with the people who advise every SMB in Cleveland.

### IDEA 11: The "AI Speed Demo" -- Live Website Build in 60 Minutes

**The idea:**
Host a live event (in person at a Cleveland co-working space, or virtual on Zoom). The event: "Watch Me Build a Complete Business Website in 60 Minutes Using AI."

Marcin picks a real business (from the audience, if possible) and builds their entire website live. Design, code, content, deploy. In one hour. On stage. With a countdown timer.

The audience watches in real-time as a beautiful, functional website appears from nothing. The business owner whose site it is gets to keep it for free.

**Why it could work:**
- This is a magic trick. The audience does not understand how it is possible. That gap between expectation ("websites take months") and reality ("he just built one in an hour") creates awe. Awe creates memorability. Memorability creates referrals.
- It demonstrates AI leverage in a way that no LinkedIn post or blog article ever could. You are not TALKING about using AI to work faster. You are SHOWING it, live, with a clock.
- The business owner in the audience whose site gets built becomes an instant evangelist. They did not pay. They got a professional website on stage. They will tell everyone they know.
- The event can be recorded and repurposed as YouTube/LinkedIn content
- It creates an event-based lead funnel: "Interested in attending the next live build? Sign up here."
- Local media loves this kind of story. "Cleveland consultant builds websites in 60 minutes using AI" is a Crain's Cleveland Business feature waiting to happen.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Book a room at a Cleveland co-working space (Galvanize, Industrious, or WeWork). Many offer free event space for members or small deposits.
2. Post the event on LinkedIn, Eventbrite, and Cleveland Facebook groups: "Live: Watch Me Build a Complete Website in 60 Minutes. Free to attend. Free website for one lucky business. RSVP: [link]"
3. Prepare your stack: have your Next.js boilerplate ready, your AI tools dialed in, your deployment pipeline one-click. Practice the build 2-3 times so the 60-minute constraint is achievable.
4. On event day: pick a volunteer from the audience. Ask them about their business for 5 minutes. Build for 55 minutes. Deploy live. Audience watches the whole thing.
5. Close with: "If you want me to do this for your business -- not in 60 minutes, but in a week, with proper strategy and SEO -- here is how to book a call."

**Expected result:** 15-30 attendees at the first event. 3-5 serious leads. One incredible content piece. Local media interest. The beginnings of a "must-attend" Cleveland business event.

**Risk level: MEDIUM.** The risk is failing on stage (the build does not finish, or it looks bad). Mitigate by practicing 3x and having a backup plan. Even if the site is 80% done at 60 minutes, the audience will be impressed.

## SECTION 5: THE "NOAH KAGAN $1M WEEKEND" ANGLE

### IDEA 12: The 48-Hour Blitz -- $1,000 by Sunday Night

**The idea:**
If Marcin had to make $1,000 from a new client by Sunday night, here is the exact play:

**Friday 9am:** Open Google Maps. Search "Cleveland [industry]" for 5 industries: restaurants, HVAC, dental, real estate agents, gyms. For each industry, find 5 businesses whose websites are visibly terrible (slow, not mobile-friendly, no contact form above the fold, GoDaddy builder template). That is 25 businesses. Time: 1 hour.

**Friday 10am-2pm:** Record a 3-minute Loom video for each of the top 10 (the ones with the worst sites and the best-looking businesses). In each video: "Hi [Name], I am Marcin. I build websites for businesses like yours. I looked at your site and found 3 things that are probably costing you customers. Here they are..." Share screen, show the problems, quantify the cost. End with: "I can fix all three for $997 this weekend. No risk -- if you do not like the result, you do not pay." Time: 3 hours.

**Friday 2pm-4pm:** Send all 10 Looms via email. Find the owner's email via the website, Google, or LinkedIn. Subject line: "Quick video about [Business Name]'s website." Time: 1 hour.

**Friday evening through Saturday:** Wait for responses. Follow up with anyone who opens the email (use Mailtrack or a similar tool to see opens).

**Statistically:** 10 Looms at 30% response rate = 3 conversations. 3 conversations at 33% close rate = 1 sale. Revenue: $997.

**What you deliver for $997:**
- Fix their mobile experience (responsive CSS, readable text, tappable buttons)
- Add a clear call-to-action above the fold on every page
- Fix their page speed (compress images, remove unnecessary plugins)
- Set up Google Analytics so they can see what happens next
- Deliver by Sunday evening

This is a 4-6 hour job for someone with your skills. The client gets massive value. You get $997 and a testimonial.

**Why it could work:**
- The price point ($997) is in the "impulse buy" zone for a business owner. It is less than their monthly rent. It requires no committee decision.
- The video is the sales pitch. You are not asking them to buy -- you are showing them what is broken and offering to fix it. The selling is done by their own eyes looking at their own broken website.
- The guarantee ("do not pay if you do not like it") removes all friction
- Weekend delivery is itself a differentiator. No consultant delivers on Saturday.
- The result (a better website by Monday morning) has an immediate, visible payoff. They can show their staff on Monday.

**Expected result:** $997 in revenue by Sunday. 1 new client relationship. 1 testimonial. 10 warm contacts for follow-up next week.

**Risk level: VERY LOW.** You invest 8-10 hours of time across the weekend. Even if nobody buys, you have 10 Loom videos you can repurpose as LinkedIn content.

### IDEA 13: Pre-Sell Before Building -- The "Website Sprint Deposit"

**The idea:**
Instead of building first and selling second, sell first and build second. Create a landing page: "Website Sprint: Your new website in 7 days. Deposit $500 to reserve your spot. Only 3 spots per month."

The $500 is a commitment device, not a payment. It confirms the client is serious. It gets refunded if they do not move forward after the discovery call. It converts to a credit toward the full project if they do.

Run ads to this page. Total budget: $300 for a 2-week test on Facebook/Instagram, targeting Cleveland business owners. Ad copy: "Your website is losing you customers. I can fix it in 7 days. $500 deposit holds your spot. Only 3 spots open for [month]."

**Why it could work:**
- The deposit validates demand before you invest a single hour of work. If 0 people deposit, the market is telling you something. If 5 people deposit, you have a waiting list.
- Scarcity ("3 spots per month") is real because you literally cannot do more than 3 website sprints per month
- The refundable deposit eliminates buyer risk while filtering for seriousness
- $300 in ads to generate $500+ in deposits is immediately cash-flow positive
- This is the Noah Kagan "validate before building" approach applied to services, not products

**How to execute this week:**
1. Build the landing page on niceright.co/sprint. Simple: headline, 3 bullet points, testimonial, deposit button (Stripe checkout for $500).
2. Set up a Facebook Business Manager account. Create one ad. Target: Cleveland, 25-65, business owners / small business interests. Budget: $20/day for 2 weeks.
3. Run the ad. Track deposits.
4. For every deposit: schedule a 20-minute discovery call. Qualify. If good fit, convert to full project. If not, refund the deposit.

**Expected result:** 2-4 deposits in 2 weeks at $300 ad spend. At least 1 converts to a full $5,000 project. You have validated the offer AND generated revenue AND built a list of interested prospects.

**Risk level: LOW.** $300 ad spend is the only financial risk. You learn either that the offer works (and you scale it) or that it needs adjustment (and you saved thousands in wasted effort).

## SECTION 6: THE WEIRD ONES

### IDEA 14: Charge $25,000. For Everything.

**The idea:**
Counterintuitive: instead of trying to make your services cheaper and more accessible, make them dramatically MORE expensive. Create a single premium offer: "The Full Digital Build. $25,000. Everything."

What "everything" means: website, SEO setup, Google Business optimization, email automation sequence, analytics dashboard, social media profile optimization, competitive analysis report, quarterly strategy calls for 12 months. The business owner pays $25,000 and does not think about their digital presence for a year.

**Why it could work:**
- There is an entire tier of SMB client -- the business doing $1M-$5M in revenue -- who does not want a $5,000 website. They want SOMEONE TO HANDLE IT ALL. The $5K buyer is looking for a deal. The $25K buyer is looking for a solution. These are different people and the $25K buyer is easier to serve because they do not nickel-and-dime you.
- At $25,000, you only need 8 clients per year to hit $200K. That is less than 1 per month. Your sales pressure drops dramatically. You can be selective.
- Premium pricing is its own sales tool. The price signals quality. "He charges $25K? He must be good." This is not theory -- it is documented in every pricing psychology study. Wines that cost more taste better. Consultants who charge more are perceived as more competent.
- The "everything" framing eliminates decision fatigue. The client does not have to choose between your $5K tier and your $10K tier and your retainer option. They choose between "do it" and "do not do it." One decision. That is powerful.
- Your competition cannot match this because they do not have the breadth. An agency can charge $25K but they split it across 5 people. A freelancer can charge $25K but they cannot deliver "everything." You are the only person who can offer the full stack from a single point of contact at this price.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Do not put this on the website. This is a conversation offer, not a landing page offer. It is for qualified prospects who have the budget and the need.
2. When you are on a discovery call with a business doing $1M+ in revenue, after diagnosing their problems, present the option: "I can fix [specific thing] for $8,000. Or I can take over your entire digital presence for $25,000 for the year -- website, SEO, automation, analytics, everything. You do not think about it. I handle it all."
3. Some will say "just the website." Some will say "tell me more about the $25K." The people who say the second thing are your best clients.

**Expected result:** 1 client in the first 3 months. Revenue: $25,000. Time investment: significant (40-60 hours for the initial build + 5 hours/month ongoing). But the revenue-per-client ratio is transformative.

**Risk level: LOW.** You are not committing to anything. You are adding an option to your menu. If nobody buys it, you still sell the $5K-$10K projects.

### IDEA 15: The "Anti-Agency" Movement

**The idea:**
Stop selling web services. Start selling a philosophy. The philosophy: **Agencies are ripping off small businesses, and it is time someone said it out loud.**

Write a manifesto. Publish it on niceright.co/manifesto and on LinkedIn. The core argument: agencies charge $15K-$40K for websites that a senior solo practitioner can build in 2 weeks for a third of the price. The markup is not for better work -- it is for the corner office, the account managers, the Slack channels, the project management overhead, and the junior developers learning on your dime. You, the small business owner, are subsidizing an agency's lifestyle.

Marcin is the alternative. One senior person. Direct access. Same quality. No overhead. No BS.

Then build a series of content around this theme:
- "What agencies charge vs. what things cost: a breakdown"
- "I used to work at an agency. Here is what we charged vs. what it cost us to deliver."
- "The agency business model, explained for business owners"
- "Why your $20K website was built by a $50K/year junior developer"

**Why it could work:**
- Polarization creates attention. People who agree share it aggressively ("FINALLY someone said it!"). People who disagree share it angrily ("This guy is wrong, here is why"). Both are distribution.
- Every business owner who has been burned by an agency will read this and feel seen. That is the beginning of a relationship.
- It draws a line: you are either with the agencies or with Marcin. This is how movements start. Gary Halbert did not sell letters. He sold the idea that advertising agencies were con artists and he was the honest alternative.
- It gives you a recurring content angle. Every week you can post a new "anti-agency" insight. It never runs out of material because agencies keep charging too much.
- It makes the competition your marketing. Every time someone has a bad agency experience, they become your lead.
- You have credibility here. You WORKED at agencies. You know the markup. You know the process. You can speak from inside the house.

**How to execute this week:**
1. Write the manifesto. 1,000 words. Be honest, not mean. Do not attack specific agencies by name. Attack the model, not the people.
2. Publish on niceright.co/manifesto and as a LinkedIn article.
3. Promote with a LinkedIn post: "I worked at agencies for 6 years. Here is what I wish every small business owner knew about what you are really paying for."
4. Follow up weekly with supporting content: one anti-agency insight per week, forever. Each one links back to the manifesto and to the "book a call" page.

**Expected result:** The manifesto becomes the single most-shared piece of content on your LinkedIn. It polarizes the web industry (some people will be mad, which is free PR). It positions you as the champion of the small business owner. Inbound leads increase 3-5x within 60 days.

**Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM.** The risk is burning bridges with agency contacts (former employers, potential subcontract partners). Mitigate by critiquing the MODEL, not specific agencies. "The agency business model is broken for small businesses" is different from "Comrade charges too much." Stay above the line.

## IF I WERE MARCIN: THE EXACT 30-DAY PLAN

I would not do all 15. I would stack 5 of them in a specific sequence that builds on itself.

### Week 1: Prove You Can Sell (Ideas 12 + 4)

**Monday-Friday:** Execute the 48-Hour Blitz (#12). Record 10 Loom videos for Cleveland businesses with bad websites. Send them. Follow up. Close 1 at $997. This proves to yourself that people will pay you. That psychological proof is worth more than any strategy document.

**Simultaneously:** Write the "Pay After You See It" offer page (#4). Get it live on niceright.co/week. Share with your warm network.

**Week 1 revenue target:** $997-$5,000

### Week 2: Start the Content Engine (Ideas 1 + 8)

**Monday, Wednesday, Friday:** Post 3 "uninvited audit" videos on LinkedIn (#1). Tag the businesses. End each one with "want yours reviewed? Drop your URL."

**Thursday:** Write and publish the first "Cleveland Website Hall of Shame & Fame" (#8). Tag all 10 businesses.

**Week 2 revenue target:** $0 (this is planting, not harvesting)

### Week 3: Build the Alliance (Ideas 10 + 9)

**Monday-Wednesday:** Email 10 Cleveland accountants with the free website offer (#10). Book 3-5 coffee meetings.

**Thursday:** Launch the first "Website Office Hours" Zoom session (#9). Post the link everywhere.

**Week 3 revenue target:** $0-$5,000 (from Week 1 pipeline closing)

### Week 4: Scale What Works, Kill What Does Not

**Review:** Which of the 5 plays generated the most conversations? Double down on that one. Kill or pause the others.

**If the Loom videos are working:** Do 4/day instead of 3/week. This is now your primary outbound channel.

**If the office hours had attendees:** Invite every attendee to a 1-on-1 discovery call.

**If an accountant bit:** Build their site immediately. This is the highest-leverage investment you can make.

**Week 4 revenue target:** $2,000-$10,000 (from compounding pipeline)

### Month 1 total target: $5,000-$15,000

This is not a fantasy number. It is the math of 10 Loom videos/week x 30% response rate x 20% close rate x $997-$5,000 average deal = 2-4 paying clients in 30 days.

## THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANY OF THESE IDEAS

All 15 ideas share one property: they require Marcin to be visible.

Not "visible" as in "has a website." Visible as in "people see him doing things, in public, regularly."

The videos. The events. The reports. The office hours. The manifesto. They all work for the same reason: they put Marcin in front of people who need what he sells, demonstrating competence through action rather than claiming it through copy.

The site is beautiful. The portfolio is strong. The case studies are legitimate. But nobody is looking at them because nobody knows they exist. The site is a library with no door. These 15 ideas are doors.

Pick 3. Open them. Walk through. The rest takes care of itself.
