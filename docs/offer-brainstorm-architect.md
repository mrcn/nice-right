## Why This Document Exists (And Why the Previous Version Is Scrapped)

The previous offer architecture had five solid offers -- Website Sprint, Digital Department, Agency Partner, Revenue Rescue, Launch and Grow -- but all of them shared a fatal flaw: **they assume someone is already looking for Marcin.** Every offer required outbound cold prospecting as the primary demand engine. Loom videos, cold emails, cold walk-ins.

That approach works. It is also a grind that produces results in 6-12 months, not 6-12 weeks. When you have zero leads, the offers themselves need to create demand -- they need to be interesting enough, different enough, or valuable enough that people talk about them, share them, or seek them out.

This version designs five offers where the offer IS the marketing.

## The Core Insight: What Marcin Actually Sells

After reading every piece of prior research, the positioning analysis, the psychology breakdown, the revenue math, and the wild brainstorm, one pattern is undeniable:

**Every testimonial praises the same thing: Marcin makes non-technical people understand technology and then builds the right thing.** Not "he built a great website." Not "his code was clean." The thing people remember is: "He explained it so I understood. He recommended things I did not ask for. He built what we actually needed, not what we thought we wanted."

That is not a website builder. That is a diagnostic mind with execution ability.

The offers below are built around that reality.

## Offer 1: The $500 Teardown

### Offer Name
**"The $500 Teardown"**

No fancy branding. No "Growth Audit." No "Digital Diagnostic." A teardown. The word itself tells you what happens: someone takes your website apart, shows you what is broken, and tells you how to fix it.

### Who It Is For
**Local business owners (Chicago metro) who suspect their website is not working but do not know why.** Specifically:
- Businesses doing $500K-$5M in annual revenue
- Owner-operators who make the buying decisions
- Businesses with an existing website that is at least 2 years old
- Industries with high customer lifetime value: home services, dental, legal, med spa, auto repair, restaurants with catering, specialty retail

**The buyer is NOT someone who wants a new website.** The buyer is someone who wants to know if they need a new website -- or if three changes to their existing one would solve the problem. That distinction matters. It lowers the commitment threshold from "$5,000-$15,000 for something I might not need" to "$500 to find out what is actually going on."

### What They Get (Specific Deliverables)

1. **A 15-minute personalized video walkthrough** where Marcin shares his screen, pulls up their site, their competitors' sites, and their Google presence, and narrates exactly what is working, what is broken, and what it is costing them. Not a slide deck. Not a PDF. A video of a real expert looking at their real business and talking to them directly.

2. **A one-page priority matrix** -- a single printed page (or PDF) with three columns:
   - **Fix This Week (free):** Things they can change themselves in under an hour (wrong phone number, missing Google hours, broken link, no mobile tap-to-call)
   - **Fix This Month ($):** Changes that require a professional but are bounded (page speed optimization, meta tag fixes, Google Business Profile overhaul, adding reviews to the homepage)
   - **Fix This Quarter ($$):** Structural changes that move the needle (site redesign, new conversion flow, landing pages for key services, SEO content strategy)

3. **A competitor snapshot** -- screenshots and key metrics for their top 3 local competitors' websites. What the competitors are doing that the client is not. Specific examples, not generalities.

4. **A 30-minute live call** where Marcin walks through the findings, answers questions, and gives the business owner a clear recommendation: "Here is what I would do if this were my business, in this order, for these reasons."

**What it does NOT include:** Implementation. The teardown is diagnostic only. Marcin tells them what to do. He does not do it (yet).

### What It Costs

**$500. Flat. Paid upfront.** No deposits, no installments. Five hundred dollars for the whole thing. Delivered within 5 business days of payment.

### Why $500

- **Low enough to be a fast decision.** A business owner doing $1M does not need board approval for $500. It is a business expense, not a capital decision.
- **High enough to be taken seriously.** Free audits attract tire-kickers. $500 attracts people who have a real problem and want a real answer.
- **High enough to be profitable.** At 3-4 hours of actual work (1 hour research, 1 hour video recording, 0.5 hours priority matrix, 0.5 hours competitor snapshot, 1 hour call), the effective rate is $125-$167/hour. Not Marcin's target rate, but profitable enough for a door-opener.
- **Psychologically positioned as a steal.** When the call happens and Marcin delivers genuinely useful advice for 30 minutes, the business owner thinks: "I paid $500 and got more useful information than I got from the agency that charged me $20,000." That feeling is what generates referrals.

### How It Creates Its Own Demand

**This is the critical part. The teardown is not just a service -- it is a content machine.**

1. **Every teardown produces a case study.** With the client's permission (ask every time, most will say yes because it is flattering), the video walkthrough becomes a "before" artifact. When Marcin later does the fix, the before/after comparison is automatic.

2. **The free version of the teardown IS the outreach.** Instead of cold emails that say "I build websites," Marcin records a 3-minute mini-teardown of a prospect's site and sends it for free. The mini-teardown (not the full $500 version) demonstrates competence instantly. The CTA is: "I found these issues in 3 minutes. The full $500 teardown goes 10x deeper. Want one?"

3. **Teardowns are shareable.** When Marcin finds a genuinely interesting problem or a clever competitor move, he posts it on LinkedIn (anonymized or with permission). "Looked at a Chicago plumber's website today. They have 200 Google reviews at 4.9 stars but zero testimonials on their site. That mismatch is probably costing them 15-20 calls per month. Here is why..." This is content that business owners share with other business owners. It is specific, useful, and demonstrates expertise without selling.

4. **Referral engine.** After every teardown call, Marcin says: "If you know another business owner who is frustrated with their website, I will give you both $50 off your next engagement." $50 is small but the gesture triggers reciprocity.

### Delivery Timeline

**5 business days from payment to final call.**
- Day 1-2: Research, recording, matrix creation
- Day 3: Send video and matrix to client
- Day 4-5: Schedule and conduct live call

With AI tools (Claude for research synthesis, analysis assistance for competitive snapshots), the research phase compresses to under 2 hours. Total time per teardown: 3-4 hours.

### Why Someone Would Say Yes TODAY

**Because it costs less than dinner for two at a nice restaurant and it answers the question that has been nagging them for months: "Is my website actually doing anything?"**

The urgency is not artificial. It is inherent in the problem. Every day their website underperforms is a day they are losing customers to competitors who show up first on Google, load faster on mobile, or have a working contact form. The teardown quantifies that loss. Once you know you are losing $3,000/month to a fixable problem, waiting feels expensive.

### How It Leads to the Next Offer

The teardown is the entry point to the entire value ladder. At the end of every teardown call:

"Now you have the roadmap. You have three options: (1) take this list and implement it yourself or with your current developer -- you have everything you need, (2) let me handle the quick wins this month -- I can knock out the 'Fix This Week' and 'Fix This Month' items in a focused sprint, or (3) if the structural work makes sense, I can put together a proposal for that too. No pressure either way. The teardown is yours regardless."

Option 2 leads to Offer 2 (14-Day Site) or a smaller implementation sprint.
Option 3 leads to Offer 4 (Competitor Funeral) for larger engagements.

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**"For $500, I'll tear apart your website on video, show you exactly what's costing you customers, and tell you how to fix it -- whether you hire me or not."**

---

## Offer 2: The 14-Day Site

### Offer Name
**"New Website in 14 Days -- or It's Free"**

Not "Website Sprint." Not "Build and Launch." The name includes the guarantee. The guarantee IS the name. When someone hears "new website in 14 days or it's free," they remember it. They repeat it. They tell other business owners. The guarantee does the marketing.

### Who It Is For

**Small businesses that need a new website and are tired of the 3-month agency timeline.** Specifically:
- Businesses whose teardown revealed that the existing site needs replacement, not repair
- Businesses starting fresh (new location, new brand, pivot)
- Businesses that have been "meaning to redo the website" for 6-18 months and keep procrastinating because every quote they get is $10K+ and 8-12 weeks
- Family businesses, franchise locations, professional practices, local services, restaurants, specialty retail

**The ideal buyer:** Someone who has already been through the teardown (Offer 1) and knows exactly what they need. The teardown removes the uncertainty. The 14-Day Site removes the delay.

### What They Get (Specific Deliverables)

**A complete, professional, conversion-optimized website delivered in 14 calendar days:**

- 5-8 pages (Home, About, Services/Menu, Contact, plus 1-3 service-specific or location pages)
- Mobile-first responsive design (tested on real devices, not just a browser resize)
- SEO foundation: title tags, meta descriptions, alt text, schema markup for local business, XML sitemap, Google Search Console connection
- Google Analytics 4 setup with conversion tracking (form submissions, phone clicks, direction requests)
- Google Business Profile audit and optimization (as a bonus, not a separate charge)
- Contact form with email notifications (no $50/month form subscription -- built into the site)
- Tap-to-call on mobile
- Fast loading (target: under 2 seconds on mobile)
- All content written collaboratively (one 60-minute content session where Marcin interviews the client and writes the copy from the conversation -- most business owners cannot write about themselves, but they can talk about their business for an hour)
- One round of revisions after initial build
- 30-day post-launch support (bug fixes, minor text edits, "how do I change this?" questions)
- Full ownership: client owns the domain, the code, the hosting account, all credentials. No lock-in.

**What it does NOT include:** E-commerce with 100+ products, custom web applications, ongoing marketing, paid advertising management, brand identity design (logo, colors -- they need to come in with at least a basic brand). Those are separate engagements.

### What It Costs

**$6,000 flat.** Paid in two installments: $3,000 at kickoff, $3,000 at launch.

### Why $6,000 (Not $5,000, Not $8,000)

- **$5,000 is the floor for a credible professional website.** Going below $5K invites comparison with template mills and signals "budget" work. But $5K also leaves very thin margins on a 14-day timeline.
- **$6,000 at 40-50 hours of work = $120-$150/hour effective rate.** With AI-assisted development (Claude Code for Next.js scaffolding, component generation, content editing), the actual build time compresses to 30-35 hours. At 35 hours, the effective rate is $171/hour -- within the target range.
- **$6,000 is low enough for a fast decision.** An established business doing $500K+ can justify $6K for a critical business asset. It is cheaper than one month of a marketing employee's salary.
- **The $6,000 number is memorable and easy to say.** "Six grand for a new website in two weeks." Clean. No ambiguity.

Payment terms: 50/50 split eliminates the "what if it sucks" fear. The client only commits the second half after seeing the site.

### The Guarantee

**"14 calendar days from kickoff to launch-ready site, or I refund your deposit in full."**

The conditions:
- "Launch-ready" means the site is complete, reviewed, and approved by the client
- The clock starts when the client provides: (a) brand assets (logo, colors), (b) completes the 60-minute content session, and (c) pays the deposit
- If the client delays providing feedback or assets, the clock pauses (documented in the agreement)
- If Marcin misses the deadline due to his own capacity, the $3,000 deposit is refunded and the client keeps whatever work has been completed

**Why this guarantee is safe for Marcin:**
- He built 100+ SMB websites at Comrade. The production process is muscle memory.
- Two weeks was the standard timeline at the agency for SMB sites. This is not heroic -- it is normal for someone with his experience.
- AI tools compress the build time significantly. What took 60-80 hours in 2022 takes 30-40 in 2026.
- The scope is tightly bounded (5-8 pages, no custom apps, no e-commerce). Scope creep is the enemy of timelines, and this offer eliminates it structurally.
- The guarantee will almost never be triggered. And on the rare occasion it is, the cost ($3K refund) is less than the reputational damage of delivering late without accountability.

### How It Creates Its Own Demand

1. **The guarantee is the headline.** "14 days or free" is a statement people repeat. When a Chicago business owner tells a fellow business owner "this guy built my website in two weeks and guaranteed the timeline," that is word-of-mouth marketing that no amount of cold outreach can match.

2. **Launch announcements are content.** Every completed site gets a LinkedIn post: "Just launched [Business Name]'s new website. Day 1 to live in 14 days. Here is what we built and why." Tag the business owner. They share it with their network. Their network sees a real result from a real person.

3. **Teardown-to-build pipeline.** Every $500 teardown that reveals "you need a new site" is a warm lead for the 14-Day Site. The teardown already identified the problems. The 14-Day Site fixes them. The prospect does not need to be convinced the work is necessary -- the teardown already did that.

4. **Speed is a differentiator that sells itself.** In a market where agencies quote 8-12 weeks and freelancers quote 4-6 weeks, "14 days guaranteed" is remarkable in the literal sense -- people remark on it. Remarkable things spread without advertising.

### Delivery Timeline

**14 calendar days, structured as:**
- Day 0: Kickoff (payment, content session, brand assets received)
- Day 1-3: Design -- wireframe, visual design, client approval on direction
- Day 4-9: Build -- development, content integration, SEO setup, analytics
- Day 10-11: Client review and revision round
- Day 12-13: Final polish, testing, pre-launch checklist
- Day 14: Launch

With AI-assisted development, this timeline has built-in buffer. The actual development work (Days 4-9) can be compressed to 3-4 days with Claude Code and component libraries.

### Why Someone Would Say Yes TODAY

**Because they have been putting this off for a year and now someone is offering to solve the problem in two weeks with a guarantee.**

The real urgency for most SMB owners is not seasonal or competitive. It is emotional. They are embarrassed by their website. They apologize for it when they give out the URL. They know it is losing them business. The 14-Day Site says: "This will be over in two weeks. You will be proud of your site by the end of the month."

### How It Leads to the Next Offer

At the 30-day post-launch check-in:

"Your site is live and performing. Here is what the numbers say after 30 days: [traffic, leads, Google performance]. There are three things I would do over the next 90 days to keep the momentum going: [specific recommendations]. Most of my clients move into a monthly arrangement at this point -- I handle the digital side so you can focus on running the business. Want me to show you what that looks like?"

This leads to Offer 3 (The Invisible Department).

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**"I build complete, professional websites for small businesses in 14 days flat -- six grand, guaranteed timeline, you own everything."**

---

## Offer 3: The Invisible Department

### Offer Name
**"Your Invisible Digital Department"**

Not "retainer." Not "Growth Partnership." Not "Fractional Digital Director." The name communicates the value proposition directly: the client gets a digital department without hiring anyone, without managing anyone, without even thinking about it. It is invisible because it works in the background. Results appear. Problems disappear. The business owner does not have to understand how.

### Who It Is For

**Businesses that already have a functioning website (often one Marcin built) and need someone to keep it working, improving, and producing results.** Specifically:
- 14-Day Site clients whose sites are live and generating early results
- Teardown clients who implemented the fixes and want ongoing optimization
- Businesses doing $1M-$10M that have no in-house marketing or tech person
- Owner-operators who are spending 5-10 hours per week on digital tasks they hate and are bad at (updating the website, responding to Google reviews, checking analytics, dealing with hosting issues, evaluating vendor pitches for SEO/ads/social media)

**The buyer psychology:** This is not someone buying a project. This is someone buying peace of mind. They want to stop thinking about their website, their Google listing, their analytics, their SEO, their email, and all the digital noise -- and know that someone competent is handling it.

### What They Get (Specific Deliverables)

**One tier. No tiers. One price. One scope.**

The complexity of tiered retainer pricing (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) creates decision paralysis. Every prior analysis recommended tiers. I am rejecting that approach because tiers work for SaaS software, not for service relationships. When you have one person (Marcin), creating three tiers implies three different levels of attention. The business owner does not want to buy "Tier 1 attention." They want to buy "Marcin pays attention."

**What the Invisible Department includes:**

- **Website ownership:** Marcin keeps the site fast, secure, updated, and working. Hosting oversight, SSL renewal, plugin/dependency updates, uptime monitoring. If something breaks at 2am, Marcin fixes it before the owner wakes up.
- **Monthly performance snapshot:** A 5-minute Loom video (not a 20-page PDF nobody reads) showing: how many people visited, where they came from, how many converted, and one thing Marcin changed this month to improve it.
- **One strategic recommendation per month:** "Based on the data, here is the one thing I would do next to grow your leads/revenue/efficiency." Just one. Not a list of 15 ideas. One clear action, with Marcin's reasoning and an estimate of impact.
- **Implementation of that recommendation:** Marcin does not just advise. He implements. If the recommendation is "add a testimonial carousel to the homepage," it is done by the end of the month. If it is "create a landing page for your highest-margin service," it is done.
- **Google Business Profile management:** Responding to reviews (drafted by AI, approved by Marcin, posted as the business), updating hours/photos/posts, monitoring for spam reviews or listing hijacks.
- **Quarterly strategy call (30 minutes):** A live conversation about the business, what has changed, what is coming next, and how the digital presence should evolve.
- **"Is this worth it?" hotline:** The business owner can text or email Marcin any time with digital questions. "A vendor is pitching me $2,000/month for SEO. Is it legit?" "Should I be on TikTok?" "My nephew says he can build me an app." Marcin responds within 24 hours with an honest assessment. This costs Marcin almost nothing (5-10 minutes per question, maybe 2-3 questions per month per client) but is worth its weight in gold to the owner.

### What It Costs

**$1,500/month. Month-to-month. Cancel any time.**

No setup fee (especially if they already went through the teardown and/or 14-Day Site). No contracts. No exit fees.

### Why $1,500/Month

- **The value math works for the client.** If the monthly recommendation and implementation generates even 2 additional customers per month for a business with $500 average transaction value, that is $1,000/month in additional revenue. The Invisible Department pays for itself and then some.
- **The capacity math works for Marcin.** At 6-8 hours per client per month (implementation work, Loom recording, GBP management, strategy, ad-hoc questions), Marcin can serve 8-10 retainer clients while still doing project work. 8 clients x $1,500 = $12,000/month revenue floor.
- **The pricing psychology works.** $1,500/month is less than a part-time employee ($2,500-$3,500/month including taxes). It is less than most marketing agency retainers ($3,000-$5,000/month). The business owner gets senior-level attention for less than the cost of a junior hire.
- **No discount for annual commitment.** The month-to-month pricing IS the price. Marcin earns the renewal every month. If the value is not there, the client should leave. This eliminates the "I'm locked into a contract I hate" resentment that poisons retainer relationships.

### How It Creates Its Own Demand

1. **Results compound and become visible.** A client who has been on the Invisible Department for 6 months has a site that ranks higher, loads faster, converts better, and looks fresher than it did 6 months ago. Their business friends notice. "Who does your website stuff?" "This guy Marcin. He just handles it."

2. **The monthly Loom is shareable proof.** When Marcin records "This month, your site got 340 visitors and 28 leads -- up from 12 leads when we started 4 months ago," the business owner shows that video to their accountant, their spouse, their business partner. The Loom becomes a referral tool.

3. **The "Is this worth it?" hotline creates loyalty and stories.** Every time Marcin saves a client $2,000 by saying "that SEO vendor is a scam, here is why," the client tells three people. These micro-moments of value are the most powerful referral generators in professional services.

4. **Stacking creates stability.** Every new retainer client raises the revenue floor permanently (until churn). By Month 8-10, the retainer base alone should cover basic living expenses, making all other revenue upside.

### Delivery Timeline

**Ongoing, monthly cycle:**
- Week 1: Review analytics, identify the monthly recommendation, begin implementation
- Week 2-3: Complete implementation, handle ad-hoc requests
- Week 4: Record Loom snapshot, send to client
- Quarterly: Schedule and conduct strategy call

### Why Someone Would Say Yes TODAY

**Because they just watched their site improve dramatically from the teardown or the 14-Day Site, and the prospect of that progress stopping is painful.**

The Newton's First Law pitch: "An object in motion stays in motion. Your site is performing better than ever. Without someone maintaining that momentum, it will decay. Google does not reward stale sites. Competitors do not stop improving. The Invisible Department keeps you moving forward, every month, without you having to think about it."

### How It Leads to the Next Offer

The Invisible Department IS the long-term relationship. It does not "lead to" something else -- it IS the something else. However, within the retainer, there are natural expansion moments:

- "Your current site has maxed out what it can do. It is time for a full rebuild" --> New 14-Day Site project ($6K)
- "Your business has outgrown a basic web presence. You need a custom app/portal" --> Custom project ($10K-$25K, scoped separately)
- "You should be doing this for your other location too" --> Second retainer ($1,500/month)
- "You need to crush your competitor who just launched a new site" --> Competitor Funeral (Offer 4)

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**"For fifteen hundred a month, I'm your invisible digital department -- I keep your website growing, your Google listing sharp, and your competitors worried, so you never have to think about tech again."**

---

## Offer 4: The Competitor Funeral

### Offer Name
**"The Competitor Funeral"**

This is the premium offer. The name is intentionally aggressive because the buyer at this level is competitive. They are not buying a website. They are buying dominance. They want to show up first on Google, look better online, convert more visitors, and take market share from a specific rival. The name says: "We are going to make your competitor's online presence irrelevant."

### Who It Is For

**Established businesses ($1M-$10M revenue) in competitive local markets who know exactly which competitor is beating them online.** Specifically:
- Home services companies that see a rival ranking #1 for every keyword
- Dental practices that lose patients to the practice across town with the better website
- Law firms that watch a competitor's Google Ads dominate their market
- Restaurants/hospitality businesses that see a competitor with 3x more Google reviews
- Any business where the owner can name the competitor they want to beat

**The buyer psychology is different from the other offers.** This is not "help me get online" or "fix my website." This is "help me win." The motivation is competitive, not defensive. These buyers have bigger budgets, faster decision-making, and clearer success criteria ("I want to outrank [competitor name] for [keyword]").

### What They Get (Specific Deliverables)

**A 90-day engagement with one measurable goal: digital dominance over a named competitor.**

**Phase 1: Intelligence (Week 1-2)**
- Full competitive audit: Marcin reverse-engineers every element of the competitor's digital presence
  - Website architecture, page count, content strategy, conversion flow
  - SEO profile: what keywords they rank for, their backlink profile, their domain authority
  - Google Business Profile: review count, review velocity, post frequency, photo count
  - Paid advertising: are they running Google Ads? What keywords? What landing pages?
  - Social media: presence, frequency, engagement
  - Technical performance: page speed, mobile experience, Core Web Vitals
- Gap analysis: exactly where the client is losing to the competitor, quantified
- Battle plan: a prioritized, sequenced plan for overtaking the competitor in each dimension

**Phase 2: Build (Week 3-8)**
- Execute the battle plan. This will vary by client but typically includes:
  - Website redesign or targeted rebuild (if the client's site is the weak link)
  - SEO offensive: keyword targeting, content creation, technical optimization, local SEO
  - Google Business Profile overhaul: review generation system, regular posting cadence, photo library
  - Conversion optimization: redesign the paths visitors take to become customers
  - Landing page creation for the client's highest-value services
  - Analytics and tracking setup to measure every improvement

**Phase 3: Measure and Dominate (Week 9-12)**
- Compare metrics against baseline and against competitor
- Double down on what is working
- Deliver a final "scoreboard" showing before/after for every tracked metric, side-by-side with the competitor
- Transition recommendation: maintain the position via the Invisible Department (Offer 3) or continue offensive with a Phase 2 engagement

### What It Costs

**$12,000 flat.** Paid in three installments: $4,000 at kickoff, $4,000 at Week 5, $4,000 at completion.

### Why $12,000

- **The ROI math is obvious.** For a business doing $2M/year, outranking their primary competitor could mean 10-20% revenue growth ($200K-$400K/year). $12K is a 30-60x return.
- **The effective rate is strong.** At 80-100 hours of total work over 90 days, the effective rate is $120-$150/hour. This is slightly below Marcin's target rate, but the engagement produces the strongest case studies, the highest referral quality, and the highest conversion to long-term retainers.
- **It is positioned below agency pricing.** An agency would charge $25K-$50K for a comparable engagement. Marcin charges $12K because he has no overhead. The client gets the same (better) work at half the price.
- **The installment structure reduces perceived risk.** The client never has more than $4K at risk. By the time the third payment is due, they have already seen 8 weeks of work.

### The Guarantee

**"If you are not outranking your named competitor on Google for your primary service keywords within 90 days, I continue working for free until you do."**

Conditions:
- "Primary service keywords" are agreed upon at kickoff (e.g., "plumber Chicago," "dentist Lincoln Park," "HVAC repair Naperville") -- maximum 5 keywords
- "Outranking" means appearing above the competitor in Google organic search results, measured by an independent rank tracker (Ahrefs, SEMrush, or BrightLocal)
- The competitor cannot have also hired an SEO firm during the engagement (if they do, the landscape changes and the guarantee adjusts)
- Marcin continues for up to an additional 60 days at no charge if the target is not met

**Why this guarantee is safe:**
- Marcin has done this 100+ times. The 290% traffic growth and 12x leads results are from exactly this type of competitive engagement.
- Most local competitors have mediocre SEO. A competent professional can outrank a mediocre competitor within 60-90 days for local service keywords in a mid-size metro.
- The guarantee is limited to specific, measurable keywords -- not a blanket "more traffic" promise that is uncontrollable.
- The guarantee is the single biggest differentiator from every other consultant in Chicago. Nobody else offers this.

### How It Creates Its Own Demand

1. **The name alone creates conversations.** "I'm working with a consultant who calls his service 'The Competitor Funeral.'" That sentence gets repeated at every Rotary Club meeting, every Chamber event, every dinner with business friends. The name is designed to be repeated.

2. **The scoreboard is a case study.** The before/after "scoreboard" delivered at the end of every engagement is the most powerful sales tool in the arsenal. It shows specific metrics, side-by-side with a named competitor (anonymized in public case studies), with clear improvement. "Client went from position 8 to position 1 for 'emergency plumber Chicago.' Competitor went from position 1 to position 3." That is not a testimonial. That is proof.

3. **Competitive buyers refer competitively.** The type of business owner who buys the Competitor Funeral is, by nature, competitive. They are also networked. They play golf with other business owners. They are in trade associations. When they dominate a competitor, they tell people how. And they name their consultant.

4. **Industry-specific wins cascade.** After Marcin buries one dentist's competitor, every other dentist in the area who hears about it thinks: "I have a competitor I want to beat too." The offer scales within verticals through reputation alone.

### Delivery Timeline

**90 days total.** Intensive, structured, with clear milestones.

### Why Someone Would Say Yes TODAY

**Because they can name the competitor and it keeps them up at night.**

This offer does not need artificial urgency. The urgency is that the competitor is online RIGHT NOW, ranking above them, stealing their customers, and getting stronger every month. Every day without action is a day the gap widens.

The pitch: "Every month you wait, [Competitor Name] gets another 30 Google reviews, another month of SEO authority, and another hundred customers that should have been yours. In 90 days, I will flip that script. Name the competitor. I will bury them."

### How It Leads to the Next Offer

The Competitor Funeral transitions naturally to the Invisible Department:

"We have achieved dominance. But the competitor is not dead -- they are just behind. If you stop investing, they will catch up within 6-12 months. The Invisible Department keeps you ahead, permanently, for $1,500/month. That is the difference between winning a battle and winning the war."

Alternatively, the engagement can lead to a second Competitor Funeral for a different market/keyword set, or expansion into additional locations.

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**"Name your biggest competitor. In 90 days, I'll make your business outrank, outperform, and outlast them online -- or I keep working for free until you do."**

## Offer 5: The Chicago SMB Teardown Show

### Offer Name
**"The Chicago Small Business Teardown"**

This is not a client-facing offer in the traditional sense. It is a content engine that feeds all the other offers. But it has its own economics, its own audience, and its own revenue potential.

### What It Is

A weekly LinkedIn video series (and optionally YouTube) where Marcin publicly reviews real Chicago-area small business websites. Each episode:

- Runs 5-8 minutes
- Features one real local business (with or without their permission -- public websites are fair game for commentary, but Marcin is constructive, not cruel)
- Shows the website on screen with Marcin narrating what is working, what is broken, and what he would change
- Includes one specific, actionable tip the business owner could implement themselves
- Ends with: "If you want a full teardown of your site, it is $500 and I deliver in 5 days. Link in the comments."

### Who It Is For

**Two audiences simultaneously:**

1. **Business owners who see their own problems reflected in the teardowns.** They watch a teardown of a dental office and think: "My website has that same problem." They do not need to be sold. The teardown sold them.

2. **Other business owners in Chicago who find the content useful and entertaining.** They become followers, share the content, and become pipeline. Not today, but eventually.

### What It Costs

**Nothing. It is free content.** The monetization happens through the offers it feeds.

### The Economics

The teardown show does not generate revenue directly. It generates the one thing Marcin has zero of: **demand.**

Here is the math:

- 1 video per week x 52 weeks = 52 videos in a year
- Each video has a potential reach of 500-5,000 views on LinkedIn (local business content performs well because it is specific and relevant to a geographic audience)
- At a conservative 1% conversion-to-inquiry rate: 5-50 inquiries per year from organic content alone
- Each inquiry feeds the $500 Teardown, which feeds the 14-Day Site, which feeds the Invisible Department, which feeds the Competitor Funeral

But the real value is not in the direct conversions. It is in three things:

1. **Positioning.** After 20 teardown videos, Marcin is "the website guy in Chicago." Not because he said it -- because he demonstrated it, publicly, 20 times. That is a level of credibility that no amount of portfolio polishing can match.

2. **Outbound becomes warm.** When Marcin cold-emails a business and they Google him, they find 20 videos of him reviewing websites like theirs. The cold email is no longer cold. It is backed by a body of work that says "this person knows what they are talking about."

3. **Referral lubrication.** When a happy client wants to refer Marcin, they can send the prospect a teardown video instead of just a name. "Watch this guy's videos. He is the real deal." The video does the selling.

### How to Produce It (Realistic for Solo + AI)

**Time per episode: 60-90 minutes total.**

- 15 minutes: Find the business, research their site and competitors
- 15 minutes: Outline 3-4 talking points (AI-assisted: Claude can draft the outline from a URL analysis)
- 20-30 minutes: Record the video (screen share + face cam)
- 10-15 minutes: Light editing (trim dead air, add intro/outro), write LinkedIn caption
- 5 minutes: Post and engage with early comments

**Weekly time commitment: 60-90 minutes.** This is achievable indefinitely. It is not a burden -- it is a habit.

### Why This Is Not Optional

Every other offer in this document answers the question "what do you sell?" This offer answers the question "why should anyone listen to you?" Without the teardown show, Marcin is another consultant claiming expertise. With the teardown show, he is demonstrating expertise every single week, in public, for free.

The teardown show is not the cherry on top. It is the foundation that makes every other offer easier to sell.

### Timeline to Impact

- **Weeks 1-4:** Nobody is watching. This is fine. The videos exist as credibility assets for outbound outreach.
- **Weeks 5-12:** Small audience forms. Local business owners start recognizing the name. First inbound inquiry from organic content.
- **Weeks 13-26:** The library has 13-26 videos. Marcin is now someone with a body of work, not just a portfolio. Outbound response rates increase because prospects Google him and find content.
- **Weeks 27-52:** Compounding. The audience is growing. Inbound inquiries are regular (1-2 per month). Referrals reference specific videos. Marcin is the default recommendation when someone in the Chicago business community asks "know anyone good for websites?"

### The One-Sentence Pitch (for the content itself)

**"Every week I tear apart a real Chicago business's website and show them exactly what's costing them customers. Free, public, no BS."**

## Revenue Math

### How These Offers Combine to Hit $15-20K/Month

The offers are not independent revenue streams. They are a connected system where each one feeds the next. Here is how they combine at different stages:

### Month 1-2: The Launch Phase

| Activity | Revenue |
|---|---|
| Teardowns (4-6 at $500) | $2,000-$3,000 |
| 14-Day Sites (1 at $6,000) | $6,000 |
| Teardown Show (content, no direct revenue) | $0 |
| Warm network activation (1 project from contacts) | $3,000-$6,000 |
| **Total** | **$11,000-$15,000** |

**How:** The first 2 weeks are pure outreach -- 50 personal messages to the warm network, plus recording 10-15 free mini-teardowns of local businesses to seed the paid teardown pipeline. By Week 3-4, the first paid teardowns are happening. By Week 4-6, the first 14-Day Site is in production.

### Month 3-4: The Pipeline Phase

| Activity | Revenue |
|---|---|
| Teardowns (4-6 at $500) | $2,000-$3,000 |
| 14-Day Sites (2 at $6,000) | $12,000 |
| Invisible Department (first 1-2 retainer clients at $1,500) | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Teardown Show (generating inbound inquiries) | Indirect |
| **Total** | **$15,500-$18,000** |

**How:** Teardown clients are converting to 14-Day Sites. The first 14-Day Site clients are completing and converting to the Invisible Department. The teardown show has 8-12 videos and is starting to generate recognition.

### Month 5-6: The Compounding Phase

| Activity | Revenue |
|---|---|
| Teardowns (3-4 at $500) | $1,500-$2,000 |
| 14-Day Sites (1-2 at $6,000) | $6,000-$12,000 |
| Invisible Department (3-4 clients at $1,500) | $4,500-$6,000 |
| Competitor Funeral (first engagement at $12,000 -- split across months) | $4,000 |
| **Total** | **$16,000-$24,000** |

**How:** The retainer base is building. The first Competitor Funeral client comes from either a teardown that revealed a competitive gap or a referral from a completed 14-Day Site. The teardown show is now 20+ episodes and Marcin is becoming known locally.

### Steady State (Month 7+): The Target Revenue

| Revenue Source | Monthly | % of Total |
|---|---|---|
| Invisible Department (6-8 clients at $1,500) | $9,000-$12,000 | 55-60% |
| 14-Day Sites (1-2 per month at $6,000) | $6,000-$12,000 | 25-35% |
| Competitor Funeral (1 per quarter, amortized) | $4,000 | 10-15% |
| Teardowns (2-3 at $500) | $1,000-$1,500 | 5-8% |
| **Total** | **$20,000-$29,500** | 100% |

### Annual Revenue at Steady State

| Scenario | Annual Revenue | Monthly Average |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative (6 retainers, 1 site/month, 1 Funeral/quarter) | $195,000 | $16,250 |
| Target (8 retainers, 1.5 sites/month, 1 Funeral/quarter) | $258,000 | $21,500 |
| Stretch (10 retainers, 2 sites/month, 2 Funerals/quarter) | $330,000 | $27,500 |

### The Revenue Floor

The most important number is not the total. It is the floor -- the revenue that comes in every month regardless of whether any new projects close.

| Month | Retainer Clients | Monthly Floor |
|---|---|---|
| Month 3 | 1-2 | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Month 6 | 3-4 | $4,500-$6,000 |
| Month 9 | 5-6 | $7,500-$9,000 |
| Month 12 | 7-8 | $10,500-$12,000 |

By Month 12, the retainer floor alone is $10,500-$12,000/month -- enough to cover basic living expenses in the Chicago area. Everything else (14-Day Sites, Competitor Funerals, Teardowns) is upside.

### Capacity Check

At steady state (8 retainers + 1.5 sites/month + content):

| Activity | Hours/Month |
|---|---|
| Invisible Department (8 clients x 6-8 hrs) | 48-64 |
| 14-Day Sites (1.5 x 35 hrs, with some overlap) | 45-53 |
| Teardowns (3 x 3.5 hrs) | 10 |
| Teardown Show (4 episodes x 1.5 hrs) | 6 |
| Competitor Funeral (amortized: ~25 hrs/month when active) | 8 (averaged) |
| Sales, admin, invoicing | 15-20 |
| **Total** | **132-161 hours/month** |

At 40 hours/week = 173 hours/month, this leaves 12-41 hours of buffer. Tight but workable. The AI leverage is what makes it possible -- compressing development time by 30-50% compared to manual work.

## First 30 Days: The Exact Action Plan

### Week 1: Activation (Days 1-7)

**Day 1-2: Warm Network Blitz**
- Write and send 50 personalized messages to professional contacts
  - Former Comrade colleagues (who is at agencies that need overflow?)
  - Northern Trust / MDRT / DEPT contacts
  - Sparkblox network (investors, advisors, fellow founders)
  - Chicago business community contacts
  - Friends, family, acquaintances who own businesses
- The message is NOT "I'm looking for clients." The message is:
  - "I'm doing something new -- weekly website teardowns for Chicago small businesses. If you know a business owner who wonders whether their website is costing them customers, I'll review their site for free."
  - This frames the ask as giving, not taking. And it seeds the teardown pipeline.

**Day 2-3: Record the first 3 teardown show episodes**
- Find 3 Chicago-area businesses with obviously fixable website problems
- Record 5-8 minute teardowns
- Post them on LinkedIn (1 per day for 3 days)
- The businesses featured may or may not respond. That is fine. The content exists for the audience, not just the featured business.

**Day 3-5: Build the teardown pipeline**
- Identify 20 local businesses that would benefit from a paid teardown
- Record a free 2-3 minute "mini-teardown" for each (shorter than the show episodes, more personalized)
- Send each one via email with: "I found a few things on your site that might be costing you customers. Here is a quick video. If you want the full teardown ($500, delivered in 5 days), just reply."
- Expected response rate: 20-30% respond. 10-15% book a call. 5-8% buy the teardown.

**Day 5-7: LinkedIn Announcement**
- Post the announcement: "After 13 years, 100+ projects, Fortune 500 and startup experience, I'm going all-in on helping Chicago small businesses win online. Starting this week, I'm tearing apart local business websites every week -- showing exactly what's working, what's broken, and what to do about it. First one is live. Watch, learn, and if you want yours reviewed, drop a comment."
- Connect with 50-100 Chicago-area business owners on LinkedIn (targeted by industry)

### Week 2: First Revenue (Days 8-14)

**Day 8-10: Conduct first paid teardowns**
- Deliver 2-3 teardowns from the Week 1 pipeline
- Record the video walkthroughs, create the priority matrices, schedule the calls
- At the end of each call, present the next step: "Based on what I found, your site needs [repair / replacement]. I can [implement the quick wins this month / build you a new site in 14 days]. Want me to put together a plan?"

**Day 10-12: Continue outreach**
- Record and send 10 more mini-teardowns
- Post teardown show episode #4
- Follow up with warm network contacts who responded positively

**Day 12-14: Close first project**
- From the 2-3 completed teardowns, at least one should be ready for the 14-Day Site conversation
- Present the proposal: "$6,000, 14 days, guaranteed timeline, you own everything"
- Collect the $3,000 deposit and begin the kickoff process

**Week 2 Revenue Target: $1,000-$4,500** (2-3 teardowns at $500 + potential deposit on first project)

### Week 3: Build Mode (Days 15-21)

**Day 15-21: Deliver the first 14-Day Site**
- If a project was closed in Week 2, this is the intensive build week
- Day 15: Kickoff -- content session, brand assets collected
- Day 16-18: Design
- Day 19-21: Development begins

**Simultaneously:**
- Post teardown show episodes #5-6
- Send 5-10 more mini-teardown outreach emails
- Follow up with all warm leads from Weeks 1-2

### Week 4: Momentum (Days 22-30)

**Day 22-28: Complete first project + close second**
- First 14-Day Site is in revision/polish phase
- Second project should be closing from the teardown pipeline
- By now, 4-6 paid teardowns have been completed
- At least 1-2 teardown clients are in conversation about a 14-Day Site

**Day 28-30: Assess and adjust**
- How many teardowns were sold? (Target: 4-6)
- How many 14-Day Sites are in pipeline? (Target: 1 in progress, 1-2 in conversation)
- How many teardown show episodes are published? (Target: 7-8)
- What is the response rate on mini-teardown outreach? (If below 10%, adjust the targeting or the video quality)
- Total Month 1 revenue should be: $8,000-$15,000

### Day 30 Revenue Target Breakdown

| Source | Target | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Paid teardowns completed | 4-6 | $2,000-$3,000 |
| First 14-Day Site (deposit collected, or project delivered) | 1 | $3,000-$6,000 |
| Warm network projects (smaller scope, from personal contacts) | 0-1 | $0-$5,000 |
| **Total Month 1** | | **$5,000-$14,000** |

### What Must Be True for This Plan to Work

1. **Marcin sends the 50 warm messages in Days 1-2.** Not Day 5. Not "when the website is ready." Day 1.
2. **Marcin records and sends 20 mini-teardowns in the first 2 weeks.** This is the single highest-leverage activity. It is the supply line for everything else.
3. **Marcin publishes 4 teardown show episodes in the first month.** Consistency matters more than quality at this stage. Episode 1 will be rough. Episode 10 will be polished. Both are useful.
4. **Marcin does NOT spend Week 1 tweaking the website, redesigning the pricing page, or perfecting the offer copy.** The offers exist in conversations, not on web pages. The website can be updated in parallel but it is not the bottleneck. Conversations are the bottleneck.
5. **Marcin prices the teardown at $500 and does not discount.** The temptation to do free teardowns "to get the first clients" is strong. Resist it. $500 qualifies the buyer. Free attracts tire-kickers. The mini-teardown (free, 2-3 minutes) is the free sample. The full teardown ($500) is the product.

### Key design principles of this ladder:

1. **Each step is a complete engagement with standalone value.** Nobody is forced to climb. The teardown is useful on its own. The 14-Day Site is useful without a retainer. The retainer is useful without a Competitor Funeral. The client buys what they need, when they need it.

2. **Each step builds trust for the next.** The teardown proves Marcin can diagnose. The 14-Day Site proves he can build. The Invisible Department proves he can sustain. The Competitor Funeral proves he can dominate. Trust compounds.

3. **Revenue per client increases non-linearly.** A client who goes through the full ladder (Teardown --> 14-Day Site --> 12 months Invisible Department --> Competitor Funeral) generates $500 + $6,000 + $18,000 + $12,000 = **$36,500 in lifetime value from a single $500 entry point.**

4. **The content engine (Teardown Show) feeds the top of the ladder perpetually.** It does not cost money. It does not require sales calls. It runs on Marcin's time and expertise. And it produces awareness, credibility, and inbound inquiries every single week.

---

## What This Architecture Gets Right That the Previous Version Did Not

1. **The demand problem is addressed structurally.** The teardown show, the mini-teardown outreach, and the shareability of the Competitor Funeral name all generate their own demand. The previous version relied entirely on cold outbound.

2. **The entry point is $500, not $5,000.** The single biggest barrier to Marcin's first independent client is the commitment level of the first ask. $500 is a fast decision. $5,000 is not. The teardown creates the relationship. The relationship creates the project. The project creates the retainer.

3. **The retainer is one tier, not three.** Decision simplicity. "Do you want the Invisible Department for $1,500/month, or not?" is a cleaner decision than "Do you want Momentum, Growth, or Scale?"

4. **The naming is visceral and memorable.** "Competitor Funeral" gets repeated. "Growth Partnership" does not. "Invisible Department" paints a picture. "Tier 2 Retainer" does not. Names matter because they are what people say when they tell someone else about you.

5. **The content engine is built into the offer architecture, not bolted on.** The teardown show is not a "marketing tactic." It is the awareness layer of the value ladder. It is as essential as the Invisible Department is to recurring revenue.

6. **AI leverage is baked into the delivery model, not the marketing.** The previous version mentioned AI but did not specify where it creates advantage. In this version: Claude Code compresses 14-Day Site development from 60 hours to 35 hours. AI-assisted research cuts teardown prep time in half. AI drafts Google Business Profile responses for Invisible Department clients. The AI is the invisible team behind the invisible department.

---

## Risks and Honest Limitations

1. **The Competitor Funeral guarantee is aggressive.** If Marcin takes on a client whose competitor has been doing serious SEO for 5 years, 90 days may not be enough. Mitigation: qualify carefully. Only guarantee for local service keywords where the competitor has a mediocre or unmanaged SEO presence.

2. **The 14-Day Site guarantee creates schedule pressure.** If Marcin has 3 projects in production simultaneously, one client delay can cascade. Mitigation: limit to 2 14-Day Sites in progress at any time. The scarcity is real ("I have one slot open for March") and protects quality.

3. **The retainer model assumes low churn.** If clients leave after 3-4 months, the floor never builds. Mitigation: the monthly Loom video with real metrics makes the value visible. Clients who see "28 leads this month vs. 12 when we started" do not cancel.

4. **The teardown show requires consistency.** If Marcin publishes 8 episodes and then stops for 3 months, the audience evaporates. Mitigation: batch-record. Record 4 episodes in one afternoon (2-3 hours total). Publish 1 per week. Stay 3-4 weeks ahead.

5. **Year 1 revenue may be below $180K.** The realistic Year 1 number is $140K-$180K depending on how fast the retainer base builds. $15K/month is achievable by Month 5-6 on a good trajectory. $20K/month is achievable by Month 8-10. $180K annual requires Month 12 run rate to be $18K+.

6. **Chicago location is an advantage and a constraint.** The teardown show leverages Chicago. The in-person meeting ability leverages Chicago. But it also limits the addressable market to one metro. Expansion to remote clients is possible by Month 6-8 once the model is proven and the content library exists.

## Summary: The Five Offers at a Glance

| # | Offer | Price | Purpose | Creates Demand By |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The $500 Teardown | $500 | Entry point, trust builder, pipeline filler | Mini-teardown outreach (free) + teardown show |

### The System in One Paragraph

Marcin publishes a weekly teardown video reviewing Chicago small business websites (free, builds awareness). Business owners who want their site reviewed pay $500 for a full teardown (entry point, builds trust). Teardown clients who need new sites get one built in 14 days for $6,000 (cash engine, builds portfolio). Completed site clients transition to the Invisible Department at $1,500/month for ongoing growth (revenue floor, builds stability). Competitive businesses who want to dominate their market hire the Competitor Funeral at $12,000 for a 90-day campaign (premium offer, builds reputation). Every offer feeds the next. Every client becomes a potential referral. Every piece of content compounds.

That is how zero leads becomes $15-20K/month in 3-6 months.
