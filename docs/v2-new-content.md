### Testimonial 1 -- Roman Panchyshyn

- **Pull quote:** "He delivered not only what was asked, but took the initiative to provide his own recommendations and went above and beyond what we asked for."
- **Full name:** Roman Panchyshyn
- **Title:** Sr. Manager UX, Northern Trust
- **Initials:** RP
- **Best placement:** Near the Results section or after the Northern Trust case study card

**Full text:** "I contracted Marcin to do some UX and Micro-animation work for us at Northern Trust and was extremely happy with the work he delivered. Although he was brought on for one small project, we extended him several more times to do some additional work. That in itself is a testament to the quality work he delivered. Marcin listened to and understood our requirements and worked independently to deliver. He delivered not only what was asked, but took the initiative to provide his own recommendations and went above and beyond what we asked for. If the opportunity ever arises, I would have Marcin join my team without hesitation."

## 2. Restructured Pricing Section

**Section label:** Your Investment
**Section headline:** Start with clarity, not a contract.

**Body copy (~80 words):**

Every engagement starts with a Digital Growth Audit -- a focused deep-dive into your business, your competitors, and where the real opportunities are. The audit is $1,500, and that fee gets credited in full toward your project if we move forward together. Most projects land between $5,000 and $15,000 depending on scope. For businesses that want ongoing momentum, the Growth Partnership runs $800-$2,500/month -- strategy, optimization, and support without hiring in-house. Need something lighter? The $500 Conversion Audit gives you a prioritized list of fixes for your existing site.

**Primary CTA:** Book Your Growth Audit
**Secondary CTA:** Get a Conversion Audit ($500)

**Reassurance line:** No retainers. No lock-in. I keep working with you because the results speak for themselves.

**Competitor anchoring line:** Agencies charge $15,000-$40,000 for the same scope. You get the same senior-level thinking at a fraction of the overhead.

## 3. FAQ Section

**Section label:** Questions
**Section headline:** Things people ask before saying yes

---

**Q: What if it doesn't work?**

A: Then we fix it. I don't hand you a website and disappear. Every project includes a post-launch review where we look at the data together and adjust. Beyond that, the Growth Audit we start with is specifically designed to surface real opportunities before a single line of code gets written -- so we're building toward something with evidence behind it, not guessing.

---

**Q: Can one person really handle my project?**

A: Yes -- and that's the point. I've led teams at agencies and on Fortune 500 engagements. I know how to scope, design, build, and ship. You get one person who understands the full picture, not five people who each know a slice. For projects that genuinely need extra hands, I bring in specialists I trust. But you always talk to me.

---

**Q: Why not just hire an agency?**

A: You can. You'll pay 3-5x more, wait longer, and spend half your meetings explaining your business to whoever they rotate onto your account that month. Agencies are built on overhead -- project managers, account execs, office leases. I'm built on doing the work. Same experience, direct access, no markup on middlemen.

---

**Q: What if I don't know what I need?**

A: That's the most common starting point, and it's completely fine. The Growth Audit exists for exactly this. We'll look at your business goals, your current digital presence, and what your competitors are doing -- then I'll tell you, plainly, what would actually move the needle. Sometimes it's a new site. Sometimes it's three changes to the one you have.

---

**Q: How long until I see results?**

A: Most projects go live within 4-8 weeks. Quick wins like speed improvements, SEO fixes, or conversion tweaks often show up within days of launch. Bigger outcomes -- lead generation, search rankings, operational savings -- build over the first 2-3 months. I'll set realistic timelines up front so you know exactly what to expect and when.

---

**Q: What's the first step?**

A: Book a free 20-minute call. You tell me where your business is and where you want it to go. I'll be honest about whether I can help -- and if I can, I'll outline what that looks like. No pitch deck, no pressure, no follow-up spam. Just a conversation.

## 4. Updated About Section

**Headline:** Hi, I'm Marcin.

**Body:**

I spent years building digital products at the enterprise level -- designing animation systems for Northern Trust, architecting healthcare portals that handle multimillion-dollar transactions, leading teams at agencies. I was good at it. But I kept noticing the same thing: small businesses were getting the worst deal in tech. Agencies charged them Fortune 500 prices for template work. Freelancers left them with sites they couldn't maintain. And the DIY tools that promised to "make it easy" made it easy to stay invisible.

So I made a choice. The same way a Michelin-trained chef might leave a hotel kitchen to open a neighborhood restaurant, I took everything I learned building for the biggest companies and focused it where it actually changes lives -- on businesses like yours.

That range is intentional. I've built for a dog waste removal service and a Fortune 500 bank. A family taqueria and a blockchain conservation platform. A vintage jewelry dealer and a healthcare investment firm. Each one got the same level of strategic thinking and craft. The only difference is the scale.

No account managers. No juniors learning on your dime. When you hire Nice Right, you work directly with me -- the same person who designed micro-interactions for Northern Trust and built a restaurant's entire web presence over a weekend.

Currently working with clients in financial services, healthcare, food service, e-commerce, conservation tech, and local services.

## 6. New "Problem" Section

**Placement:** After hero, before services.
**Section label:** Sound familiar?

**Body (~70 words):**

You've been burned before. The agency that charged $20,000 for a site built on a $50 template. The freelancer who vanished mid-project. The DIY website builder that looked fine until you realized nobody could find you on Google. You don't need another vendor who talks in jargon and bills in surprises. You need someone who builds things that actually work for businesses like yours -- and can prove it.
