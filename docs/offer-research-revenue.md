# Fractional CRO Analysis: Nice Right Revenue Architecture

**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Subject:** Pricing, packaging, and revenue model assessment for a solo web consultant targeting SMBs
**Analyst role:** Fractional Chief Revenue Officer

---

## Executive Summary

Nice Right is a solo consultancy run by a 13-year veteran who has delivered 100+ projects across SMB and enterprise. The current offer architecture generates a theoretical maximum of ~$120K-$150K/year with massive variance and zero floor. The core problem is not the price points themselves -- it is the structure. Revenue depends entirely on net-new project sales with no recurring engine, the most valuable offer (Growth Partnership) is buried as a footnote, and the entry-level audit attracts price-sensitive buyers who may never ascend. This analysis models the math, diagnoses the structural failures, and proposes a revenue architecture that could push the business toward $180K-$250K/year with better predictability and less sales effort.

## 1. Revenue Math: Current Model

### Assumptions
- Hard capacity: 2 projects per quarter = 8 projects per year
- "Projects" here means Build & Launch engagements (the core revenue driver)
- Conversion Audits and Growth Audits are lead generation, not revenue centers
- Growth Partnership retention is unknown (no data provided)

### Scenario Modeling

#### Best Case (everything converts, every project is large)

| Revenue Stream | Qty | Unit Price | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conversion Audits (standalone, no project) | 4 | $500 | $2,000 |
| Growth Audits (credited, so $0 net) | 8 | $0 | $0 |
| Build & Launch projects | 8 | $15,000 | $120,000 |
| Growth Partnerships | 4 clients | $2,500/mo x 12 | $120,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$242,000** |

This requires every project to land at the top of the range AND 4 retainer clients paying max rate for the full year. This is a fantasy number.

#### Likely Case (realistic mix)

| Revenue Stream | Qty | Unit Price | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conversion Audits (standalone) | 6 | $500 | $3,000 |
| Growth Audits (credited) | 6 | $0 | $0 |
| Growth Audits (standalone, did not proceed) | 2 | $1,500 | $3,000 |
| Build & Launch projects | 6 | $8,000 avg | $48,000 |
| Growth Partnerships | 2 clients | $1,200/mo x 8 avg | $19,200 |
| **Total** | | | **$73,200** |

Notes on the likely case:
- Not all 8 quarterly slots fill. Some quarters only have 1 project. Likely 6 Build & Launch projects per year.
- Average project lands at $8K, not $15K. SMBs negotiate down. The range $5K-$15K has a midpoint of $10K, but gravitational pull is toward the lower end with small business owners.
- Only 2 Growth Audits result in no project (keeping the $1,500). The other 6 get credited.
- Retainer clients: 2 active at any time, averaging $1,200/mo, churning after ~8 months.

#### Worst Case (slow year, small projects)

| Revenue Stream | Qty | Unit Price | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conversion Audits | 8 | $500 | $4,000 |
| Growth Audits (credited) | 4 | $0 | $0 |
| Build & Launch projects | 4 | $5,000 | $20,000 |
| Growth Partnerships | 1 client | $800/mo x 6 | $4,800 |
| **Total** | | | **$28,800** |

### The Problem

The likely case of $73K is survivable but not thriving for a 13-year veteran in a major metro (Cleveland cost of living is lower than coastal, but still). The worst case of $29K is a crisis. The variance between best and worst is 8.4x. That is not a business model -- that is gambling.

The fundamental issue: **revenue is 100% dependent on closing net-new projects.** There is no recurring floor. If January is dry, there is no retainer base paying the bills while new projects ramp. Every quarter starts at zero.

---

## 2. The Credit Trap: Growth Audit at $1,500 (Credited Toward Project)

### What the Current Structure Says

The Growth Audit costs $1,500, but that fee is "credited in full toward your project if we move forward together." The site also says "Yours to keep -- even if you choose a different path."

### The Problem

This structure communicates: **the audit has no standalone value.** If the fee disappears into the project cost, the client perceives the audit as a free sales pitch they happened to pay a deposit for. Revenue strategists call this the "deposit masquerade" -- the client thinks they paid for something, but the business got nothing because the payment was just moved from one column to another.

### What the Data Shows

According to research from Consulting Success and The Visible Authority, the most effective discovery/audit pricing follows this principle: **never credit 100% of the audit fee.** Here is why:

1. **It trains clients to expect free strategy.** If the audit is free-with-project, the client learns that strategic thinking has no cost. When they need strategy later (the Growth Partnership), they will resist paying for it because you already gave it away.

2. **It removes the qualification gate.** A $1,500 audit that costs $1,500 regardless of next steps filters for serious buyers. A $1,500 audit that becomes free-with-project attracts people who just want the project and see the audit as a hoop to jump through.

3. **It kills the standalone revenue stream.** If 80% of audit buyers proceed to a project, 80% of your audit revenue vanishes. You did the work. You should keep the money.

### What Top Consultants Do Instead

- **Credit 50%, not 100%.** Client pays $1,500 for the audit. If they proceed, $750 is credited. You keep $750 for the strategic work, which you earned. The client still feels a benefit.
- **Credit nothing, but offer a "fast-start" discount.** The audit is $1,500. The project is $10,000. If the client commits within 30 days, the project is $9,000. The discount exists, but it is not tied to the audit fee. The audit stands on its own as a product.
- **Make the audit more expensive and more valuable.** Charge $2,500-$3,500 for a Growth Audit that includes a full competitive analysis, customer journey map, technical audit, and a written strategy document. Credit $1,000 toward the project. You keep $1,500-$2,500 for real work, the client gets a genuine deliverable, and the higher price filters for better clients.

### Recommendation

Stop crediting 100% of the audit fee. At minimum, move to a 50% credit model. Better: make the audit a standalone product worth $2,500 with a $500-$1,000 project credit as a goodwill gesture, not a full refund of the strategic work.

## 3. Value Ladder Problems

### Current Structure (As Presented)

```
$500 Conversion Audit (one-time)
         |
         v
$1,500 Growth Audit (credited toward project)
         |
         v
$5K-$15K Build & Launch (project)
         |
         v  (buried as footnote)
$800-$2,500/mo Growth Partnership (ongoing)
```

### Why This Is Not a Value Ladder

A value ladder has three properties:
1. Each step delivers increasing value and demands increasing commitment
2. Each step **naturally** leads to the next (the client experiences a result that creates demand for the next tier)
3. Revenue compounds as clients ascend

This structure fails on all three:

**Problem 1: The $500 audit does not lead to the $1,500 audit.** There is no bridge. A client who gets a Conversion Audit gets a list of fixes. They can implement them with another developer or do nothing. There is no mechanism that creates demand for the Growth Audit. The two audits serve different functions (tactical fixes vs. strategic planning) but are presented as "light vs. heavy" versions of the same thing.

**Problem 2: The Growth Audit leads to the project but self-destructs financially.** Because the fee is credited, the audit is not a revenue step -- it is an expense that precedes revenue. The ladder has a hole in it.

**Problem 3: The Growth Partnership is invisible.** The most valuable offer for the business (recurring revenue) is mentioned in a single paragraph below the pricing cards. It is not a card. It has no features list. It has no CTA of its own. On the V3 page it is literally a `<p>` tag inside a `<div>` below the three pricing cards. This is the equivalent of burying your best product in the footnotes.

**Problem 4: There is no bridge from project completion to retainer.** The How It Works section ends at "You Grow" but does not describe what happens after launch. The client's mental model is: hire Marcin, get a website, done. There is no expectation set for ongoing engagement. The Growth Partnership needs to be positioned as the natural "what happens after launch" step, not an optional add-on.

### What Is Missing

1. **A post-launch transition.** Every project should end with a "90-day growth check-in" that naturally leads to a retainer conversation.
2. **A bridge offer between audit and project.** Something like a "Strategy Sprint" -- a 1-2 week intensive at $3,000-$5,000 that produces a working prototype or MVP, not just a document. This gives clients a taste of the build process at lower commitment.
3. **The retainer needs to be visible.** It should be a full pricing card, not a footnote. Arguably, it should be the most prominent card.

---

## 4. Recurring Revenue: The Growth Partnership

### Current State

The Growth Partnership ($800-$2,500/mo) is described in a single sentence on the pricing page:

> "Want ongoing support? The Growth Partnership ($800-$2,500/mo) gives you continuous strategy, optimization, and hands-on help -- so your digital presence keeps improving as your business grows."

On the V2/root page, it is mentioned in a paragraph of body text. No features. No deliverables. No differentiation between $800 and $2,500. No case for why a client would want this.

### The Math That Should Terrify a Solo Operator

**Project-based LTV:**
- Average project: $8,000
- Average projects per client: 1.2 (some clients come back for a second project, most do not)
- **LTV per client: ~$9,600**

**Retainer-based LTV:**
- Average retainer: $1,200/mo (midpoint of $800-$2,500, skewed low for SMBs)
- Average retention: 12-18 months (industry data for web consultants from Mat Bennett's agency advisor research)
- **LTV per client: $14,400-$21,600**

The retainer client is worth 1.5x-2.25x more than the project client. And that is before considering:

- **Acquisition cost is near zero for retainer upsells.** You already have the relationship. No sales calls, no proposals, no audits. The client just says "yes, keep going."
- **Utilization is better.** Retainer work fills gaps between projects. It smooths revenue. It eliminates the feast-or-famine cycle.
- **Referrals come from retainer clients, not project clients.** A client who worked with you for 14 months and saw continuous results will refer you more actively than a client who got a website 8 months ago and has not talked to you since.

### Where Retainer Revenue Should Sit

Industry benchmarks for healthy solo consultancies (from Consulting Success data across hundreds of firms):

| Revenue Mix | Health Rating |
|---|---|
| 0-20% recurring | Fragile -- feast or famine |
| 20-40% recurring | Stable -- but still project-dependent |
| 40-60% recurring | Strong -- predictable base, projects are gravy |
| 60%+ recurring | Thriving -- rare for solos, but achievable |

The current model is likely at 10-15% recurring (the "Likely Case" above shows $19,200 retainer on $73,200 total = 26%, but that assumes 2 retainer clients which may be optimistic). The target should be 40-50% recurring.

### What Needs to Change

1. **The Growth Partnership must become a first-class offer.** Full pricing card. Detailed deliverables. Its own landing section or page. Client results attributed to ongoing work, not just the initial build.

2. **Every project must end with a retainer conversation.** Not a sales pitch -- a natural handoff. "Your site is live. Here is what I recommend we focus on for the next 90 days. Here is what the Growth Partnership looks like." This should be built into the project scope as a "post-launch optimization phase."

3. **The retainer should be tiered clearly.** Not "$800-$2,500" with no explanation. Something like:

   - **Momentum** ($800/mo): Monthly performance review, 4 hours of updates/optimization, priority support
   - **Growth** ($1,500/mo): Everything in Momentum + A/B testing, new landing pages, SEO management, 10 hours/mo
   - **Scale** ($2,500/mo): Everything in Growth + strategy calls, analytics dashboard, campaign support, 20 hours/mo

4. **Consider a minimum engagement period.** Not a lock-in contract (the site explicitly says "no lock-in"), but a "recommended 90-day minimum to see measurable results." This sets expectations and reduces month-1 churn.

---

## 5. Capacity Constraints: Pricing Scarcity

### The Math of Scarcity

2 projects per quarter = 8 per year. At 4-8 weeks per project, with some overlap, this is approximately 32-48 weeks of project work per year. Add retainer management, sales calls, audits, and admin, and this is a fully utilized solo operator.

**The capacity is fixed. Revenue growth can only come from three places:**

1. **Higher prices per project** (raise the floor and ceiling)
2. **More revenue per client relationship** (retainers, upsells)
3. **Leverage** (productized services, templates, courses, subcontracting)

### Should Prices Go Up?

Yes. The current range of $5K-$15K is below market for a senior consultant with 13 years experience, Fortune 500 portfolio pieces, and documented results (290% traffic growth, 12x leads, 40% faster deal closing). Comparable solo consultants with similar profiles charge:

- **Senior UX consultants:** $150-$250/hour = $12K-$20K for an 80-hour project
- **Solo web strategists (10+ years):** $8K-$25K per project (source: Clutch, Upwork top-rated data)
- **Fractional digital officers:** $5K-$10K/month for ongoing strategy (comparable to Growth Partnership ceiling)

The floor should be $7,500, not $5,000. A $5,000 project for a 13-year veteran who led 100+ projects at an agency is underpriced. It attracts clients who cannot afford the Growth Partnership and will never become retainer clients. It also takes the same sales effort and onboarding time as a $12,000 project.

Recommended project range: **$7,500-$20,000.** The ceiling should go higher because some projects (custom apps, portals, automation systems) are worth $15K-$25K and the current ceiling caps perception at $15K.

### Should He Raise the Audit Prices?

The Conversion Audit at $500 is addressed in Section 7 below. The Growth Audit at $1,500 is reasonable for SMBs but should not be credited -- see Section 2.

---

## 6. Productized Services

### What Should Be Productized

Productized services work best when the scope is fixed, the deliverables are clear, the process is repeatable, and the value is obvious before the sale. Here is what fits:

#### 1. Website Performance Sprint (Productize the Conversion Audit)

**Current:** $500 Conversion Audit -- "prioritized list of high-impact fixes, delivered in 48 hours."

**Productized version:**
- **Name:** 48-Hour Website Diagnostic
- **Price:** $750 (fixed)
- **Deliverables:** 15-point performance scorecard, 5 prioritized fixes with expected impact, competitor comparison (3 competitors), Loom video walkthrough of findings
- **Turnaround:** 48 hours guaranteed
- **Why it works:** Fixed scope, fixed price, repeatable process. Can be partially templated/automated. The Loom video adds perceived value at low marginal cost.

#### 2. Growth Roadmap (Productize the Growth Audit)

**Current:** $1,500 Growth Audit -- deep-dive, roadmap, scope/timeline/budget.

**Productized version:**
- **Name:** 30-Day Growth Roadmap
- **Price:** $2,500 (fixed, no credit)
- **Deliverables:** Full competitive analysis (5 competitors), customer journey map, technical audit, 12-month digital strategy document, project scope and budget estimates for recommended work, 60-minute strategy presentation
- **Turnaround:** 2-3 weeks
- **Why it works:** The deliverable is a document the client keeps regardless of whether they hire for the project. It has tangible value. At $2,500, it filters for serious buyers.

#### 3. Monthly Growth Retainer (Productize the Partnership)

**Productized tiers** as described in Section 4 above (Momentum / Growth / Scale).

#### 4. Landing Page Sprint (NEW -- fills a gap)

- **Name:** Launch Page in a Week
- **Price:** $2,000 (fixed)
- **Deliverables:** 1 conversion-optimized landing page, mobile responsive, basic analytics setup, 1 round of revisions
- **Turnaround:** 5 business days
- **Why it works:** Many SMBs need a single landing page for a campaign, event, or product launch. They do not need a full website project. This captures revenue that currently falls through the cracks.

### What Successful Solo Consultants Do

From research across Consulting Success, Assembly, and practitioner case studies:

- **Brad Hussey** (solo web consultant): Runs productized "Website in a Day" packages at $5K-$10K. High perceived value from time constraint.
- **Nick Disabato** (solo UX consultant): Runs "Draft Revise" -- a productized A/B testing retainer at $4,900/mo. Three tiers. Fully productized, waitlist-based.
- **Val Geisler** (solo email strategist): Productized email audits at $1,500-$3,000. Fixed scope, fixed price, repeatable. Converts ~40% to ongoing retainers.

The pattern: **start with a productized diagnostic, convert to a retainer.** The project becomes optional.

---

## 7. The $500 Tier Problem

### Who Buys a $500 Audit?

At $500, the buyer is:
- **A small business owner who is uncertain.** They are not ready to commit to a $5K+ project. They want validation that their website has problems before investing further.
- **A DIY-inclined business owner.** They plan to implement the fixes themselves or hand the list to a cheaper developer. They are explicitly told they can: "Actionable -- use it yourself or hire me to implement."
- **A comparison shopper.** $500 is low enough to buy from 2-3 consultants and compare.

### Conversion Rate Expectations

For consulting audits at the $500 price point:
- **To project (Build & Launch):** 10-20%. Most $500 audit buyers are not ready for a $5K-$15K commitment. The audit satisfies their curiosity without building enough relationship to justify the larger spend.
- **To retainer:** Near 0%. A client who bought a $500 audit is not going to sign up for $800-$2,500/mo ongoing. The jump is too large.
- **To Growth Audit:** 5-15%. Some will realize they need deeper strategic work and upgrade, but most will feel the $500 audit was "enough."

Compare to the Growth Audit at $1,500:
- **To project:** 40-60%. The client has invested enough to be committed. The audit itself creates the scope and budget for the project. The deliverable creates demand for the build.
- **To retainer:** 15-25%. Clients who go through a strategic planning process are more likely to want ongoing strategic support.

### The Verdict

The $500 Conversion Audit is not a revenue problem -- $500 does not matter either way. It is a **pipeline quality problem.** It fills the top of the funnel with people who are not ready to buy the real offer. Every hour spent on a $500 audit is an hour not spent on a $1,500 Growth Audit buyer who is 3-4x more likely to become a $10K project and a $1,200/mo retainer.

### Options

1. **Raise to $750-$1,000.** This eliminates the most price-sensitive buyers without losing serious ones. At $750, the audit is still an impulse buy for a business owner but signals higher quality.

2. **Keep at $500 but cap volume.** Do no more than 2 per month. Use them strategically as a prospecting tool, not a revenue line.

3. **Replace with a free but gated resource.** Instead of a paid $500 audit, offer a free "Website Health Check" -- a short, templated assessment delivered via a 15-minute Loom video. This costs less time, attracts more leads, and positions the Growth Audit as the "real" first step. The leads who want more depth self-select into the $1,500 audit.

4. **Upgrade the deliverable and raise the price.** See Section 6, "48-Hour Website Diagnostic" at $750.

### Recommendation

Option 4. Raise to $750, add a Loom video walkthrough and competitor comparison, brand it as a "48-Hour Website Diagnostic." This is still impulse-buy territory for an SMB owner, but it filters out the worst tire-kickers and produces a deliverable that naturally leads to the Growth Audit conversation: "I found these issues. Here is what I recommend. If you want a full strategic plan for how to fix everything and grow, that is what the Growth Roadmap is for."

## 8. Anchoring and Packaging

### Current Structure

The V3 page presents three pricing cards side by side:

| Card 1 | Card 2 (Popular) | Card 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion Audit | Growth Audit | Build & Launch |
| $500 one-time | $1,500 credited | $5K-$15K project |
| (outline CTA) | (solid CTA) | (outline CTA) |

The Growth Partnership is a paragraph of text below the cards.

### Problems with This Structure

**1. The anchor is wrong.** The first number the reader sees is $500. This anchors the client's sense of what Nice Right costs at "hundreds of dollars," making the $5K-$15K project feel expensive by comparison. The anchoring effect (Kahneman, Tversky) means the first price encountered disproportionately influences willingness to pay for subsequent offers.

**2. Three cards compare incomparable things.** A one-time audit, a credited audit, and a project are three different product categories. Putting them side by side invites comparison shopping between things that should not be compared. The client thinks "which of these three should I buy?" when the answer is "you buy them in sequence."

**3. "Most Popular" on the Growth Audit is probably not true.** Is it actually the most-purchased offer? If most inquiries are about the Conversion Audit or Build & Launch, the badge is misleading and clients may sense that.

**4. The 4th offer (Growth Partnership) is invisible.** It is the highest-LTV offer and it gets no card, no features, no CTA.

### Recommendation: Restructure to 2 Entry Points + 1 Core Offer

Instead of a comparison grid, present the offers as a **journey** with two entry points:

```
ENTRY POINT A (Small commitment)          ENTRY POINT B (Ready to build)
48-Hour Website Diagnostic                 30-Day Growth Roadmap
$750 one-time                              $2,500 one-time
"Find out what's costing you customers"    "Get your complete digital growth plan"
                    \                       /
                     \                     /
                      v                   v
               YOUR PROJECT: Build & Launch
               $7,500-$20,000 based on scope
               "I design and build it. You grow."
                           |
                           v
                    KEEP GROWING
              Growth Partnership (Monthly)
              Momentum $1,200/mo | Growth $2,000/mo | Scale $3,000/mo
              "Your digital presence keeps getting better"
```

This structure:
- Anchors on $2,500 (the Growth Roadmap), not $500
- Presents a journey, not a comparison
- Makes the retainer the natural "what happens next" after the project
- Gives the retainer its own full section with tiered pricing

### On the Page

Replace the 3-card grid with a 2-column layout for the entry points, a full-width section for Build & Launch (with case study results inline), and a separate section for the Growth Partnership with its own tiered cards.

## 9. Alternative Models: What Works for Solo Consultants

### Model Comparison for Solo Web/UX Consultants

| Model | Revenue/Hour | Predictability | Scalability | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hourly billing | $100-$200/hr | Low | None | Beginners, supplemental work |
| Project-based (fixed) | $150-$300/hr effective | Medium | Low | Most solos, clear scope work |
| Value-based pricing | $300-$1,000/hr effective | Medium | Low | Experienced solos, high-ROI projects |
| Retainer | $100-$200/hr effective | High | Medium | Established solos, ongoing relationships |
| Sprint-based (weekly) | $2K-$5K/week | Medium-High | Medium | Fast-paced solos, agile clients |
| Productized | $200-$500/hr effective | High | High | Systemized solos, repeatable work |

### The Highest Revenue Per Hour: Value-Based Pricing

If a client's website redesign will generate $200K in additional annual revenue (documented via the Growth Audit), a $20K project fee is 10% of year-one value. This is a bargain. The effective hourly rate at 80 hours of work is $250/hour.

The Growth Audit naturally supports value-based pricing because it quantifies the opportunity. "Your current site is converting at 1.2%. Industry average is 3.5%. At your traffic levels, that gap costs you ~$150K/year in lost revenue. A $15K project to close that gap pays for itself in 6 weeks."

**Nice Right is already positioned for this but is not doing it.** The results data (290% traffic, 12x leads, 40% faster deal closing) enables value-based conversations. The Growth Audit is the perfect vehicle. But the pricing page shows "$5K-$15K" as a cost, not as a fraction of the value created.

### The Best Model for Nice Right

A hybrid:
- **Productized diagnostics** (audits) for lead generation and qualification
- **Value-based project pricing** for Build & Launch (anchored to projected ROI, not hours)
- **Tiered retainers** for recurring revenue and client retention
- **Sprint-based add-ons** for clients who need specific deliverables quickly (landing pages, automations)

## 10. The "Taking On 2 Projects" Line

### Current Copy

> "Currently taking on 2 new projects per quarter. Spots for Q2 2026 are open."

### Does This Help or Hurt?

**It depends on who is reading it.**

**For the right client (business owner with budget, ready to move):** Scarcity works. "Only 2 spots" creates urgency and implies demand. It signals: "this person is busy because they are good." It also pre-qualifies -- if you know there are only 2 spots, you do not waste time unless you are serious.

**For the wrong client (cautious SMB owner, first time hiring a freelancer):** This line reads as "too small to handle my business" or "too busy for me." A small business owner who has been burned by disappearing freelancers may interpret limited capacity as a risk: "What if I need something and he's booked?" This fear is particularly acute for SMB buyers who lack internal teams to fall back on.

**At this price point ($5K-$15K):** Scarcity works better at higher price points. A surgeon who takes 2 patients per week creates appropriate scarcity. A web developer who takes 2 projects per quarter at $5K-$15K reads as "part-time." The scarcity signal is fighting the price signal. At $20K-$50K per project, "only 2 per quarter" sounds exclusive. At $5K, it sounds like a side hustle.

### The Bigger Problem

The line focuses on project capacity but says nothing about retainer capacity. If the Growth Partnership is the real growth engine, the scarcity should apply there too: "Currently supporting 6 Growth Partnership clients. I have room for 2 more."

### Recommendations

1. **Keep the scarcity line but reframe it around exclusivity, not capacity.**
   - Before: "Currently taking on 2 new projects per quarter."
   - After: "I work with a small number of businesses at a time so every project gets my full attention. Q2 2026 has availability."

2. **Add retainer scarcity.** "Growth Partnership spots are limited to ensure every client gets hands-on support." This creates urgency for the highest-LTV offer.

3. **Raise prices first, then use scarcity.** The scarcity line becomes significantly more effective at $10K-$20K projects than at $5K. Get the pricing right, then the scarcity line does its job.

4. **Move the line.** It currently sits at the bottom of the pricing section. Move it closer to the primary CTA -- ideally as micro-copy below "Book Your Growth Audit" or in the hero section.

| Growth Partnership: Growth | $2,000/mo | Retainer | Recurring revenue, mid tier |
| Growth Partnership: Scale | $3,000/mo | Retainer | Recurring revenue, high tier |

### Projected Revenue (Revised Model, Likely Case)

| Revenue Stream | Qty | Unit Price | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48-Hour Website Diagnostics | 10 | $750 | $7,500 |
| 30-Day Growth Roadmaps | 8 | $2,500 | $20,000 |
| Build & Launch projects | 6 | $12,000 avg | $72,000 |
| Launch Page Sprints | 6 | $2,000 | $12,000 |
| Growth Partnership (avg) | 4 clients | $1,500/mo x 10 mo avg | $60,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$171,500** |

### Revenue Mix

| Source | Amount | % of Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics + Roadmaps | $27,500 | 16% |
| Projects + Sprints | $84,000 | 49% |
| Retainers | $60,000 | 35% |
| **Total** | **$171,500** | **100%** |

35% recurring is in the "stable" range, approaching "strong." The absolute number ($171K) is 2.3x the likely case under the current model ($73K).

### Key Differences from Current Model

1. **Growth Roadmap is not credited.** It generates $20K/year in standalone revenue instead of $0.
2. **Project floor is $7,500, not $5,000.** Average project rises from $8K to $12K.
3. **Retainer is a first-class product with 3 tiers.** Client count grows from 2 to 4 as projects convert.
4. **Launch Page Sprint fills gaps.** 6 quick projects at $2K each add $12K without consuming a full project slot.
5. **Diagnostics are raised to $750 and generate real revenue.** $7,500/year is not the point; the point is they convert to Roadmaps and projects.

### What This Requires

- Restructure the pricing page (see Section 8)
- Build a "post-launch handoff" into every project that introduces the Growth Partnership
- Create templated deliverables for the Website Diagnostic and Growth Roadmap to reduce delivery time
- Develop retainer-specific case studies showing ongoing results (not just launch results)
- Raise project floor to $7,500 and stop accepting $5K projects

## 12. Implementation Priority

| Priority | Action | Revenue Impact | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stop crediting 100% of Growth Audit | +$10K-$15K/year | Copy change only |
| 2 | Make Growth Partnership a first-class offer with tiers | +$20K-$40K/year | Page restructure |
| 3 | Raise project floor to $7,500 | +$6K-$12K/year | Pricing decision |
| 4 | Add post-launch retainer handoff to every project | +$10K-$20K/year | Process change |
| 5 | Raise Conversion Audit to $750, rebrand as Diagnostic | +$2K-$4K/year | Copy change |
| 6 | Add Landing Page Sprint productized offer | +$8K-$12K/year | New service page |
| 7 | Restructure pricing page (journey, not grid) | Conversion lift | Design work |
| 8 | Reframe scarcity line | Brand perception | Copy change |

Priorities 1-4 can be done within 30 days and represent $46K-$87K in additional annual revenue potential. Priorities 5-8 are optimizations that build on the foundation.
