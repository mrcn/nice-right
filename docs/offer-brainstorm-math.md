## 1. Productized Service Design: 3 Service Products

The goal of productization is to take Marcin's 13 years of repeatable work and package it into fixed-scope, fixed-price offerings that can be sold without a proposal, delivered faster than anyone expects, and repeated month after month. Each product below passes the "one sentence at a networking event" test.

### Product 1: The Revenue Leak Report

**One sentence:** "I find the money your website is leaving on the table -- $750, delivered in 48 hours, guaranteed to find at least $500/month in lost revenue or it's free."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Price** | $750 flat |
| **Timeline** | 48 hours from kickoff |
| **Guarantee** | Finds at least $500/month in addressable revenue leaks, or the report is free |

**Exact Deliverables:**

1. 15-point website performance scorecard (speed, mobile, SEO, conversion, UX)
2. Revenue impact estimate for each finding (not just "this is broken" but "this is costing you approximately $X/month")
3. Prioritized fix list ranked by estimated revenue impact (highest ROI first)
4. Competitor comparison snapshot (3 local competitors -- what they do that you don't)
5. 10-15 minute Loom video walkthrough of all findings in plain English
6. One-page action plan: "Do these 3 things this week"

**Required Client Inputs:**

- Website URL
- Google Analytics access (or permission to install a temporary tracking snippet)
- 15-minute intake call (business model, revenue per customer, how leads currently arrive)
- Names of 3 local competitors

**Profit Margin Analysis:**

| Component | Hours | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Intake call + research | 0.5 hrs | Templated questions, client provides URL and competitors |
| Automated data pull (PageSpeed, Ahrefs, Screaming Frog) | 0.5 hrs | Tooling runs while Marcin does other work |
| Analysis + report writing | 1.5 hrs | 60% templated sections, 40% custom analysis |
| Loom video recording | 0.5 hrs | Screen share walkthrough, unscripted |
| Packaging + delivery | 0.25 hrs | Branded PDF or Notion, email delivery |
| **Total delivery time** | **3.25 hrs** | |
| **Effective hourly rate** | **$231/hr** | |

**AI leverage savings:** Pre-AI, a comparable audit took 6-8 hours. With AI-assisted report generation, templated sections, and automated data pulls, delivery is 3.25 hours. This is a 50-60% time reduction, pushing the effective rate from ~$100/hr to $231/hr on the same deliverable.

**How many per month to hit target (standalone):**

| Scenario | Units/Month | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------|:-----------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| This product alone at $15K/mo target | 20 | $15,000 | $180,000 |
| Realistic volume (pipeline feeder) | 4-6 | $3,000-$4,500 | $36,000-$54,000 |

This product is not designed to hit the full target alone. It is a pipeline feeder. At 4-6 per month, it generates $36K-$54K/year and converts 30-40% of buyers into the next product.

---

### Product 2: Website in Two Weeks

**One sentence:** "I build a complete, professional website for your business -- $5,000 flat, done in two weeks, you own everything."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Price** | $5,000 flat |
| **Timeline** | 10 business days from content kickoff |
| **Payment** | $2,500 upfront, $2,500 at launch |
| **Guarantee** | "Love it or don't pay the second half" -- if unsatisfied at reveal, client keeps the $2,500 deposit, site does not launch |

**Exact Deliverables:**

1. Complete 5-7 page website: Home, About, Services (1-2 pages), Contact, plus 1-2 additional pages based on business needs
2. Mobile-responsive, fast-loading, SEO-ready (meta tags, schema markup, sitemap)
3. 60-minute content strategy session where Marcin interviews the client and drafts site copy collaboratively
4. Google Business Profile setup and optimization
5. Google Analytics 4 + Search Console configuration
6. Contact form or booking integration (Cal.com, Calendly, Jobber, OpenTable -- whatever they use)
7. 30-day post-launch check-in call (review traffic, identify quick wins)
8. All code, design files, domain access, and hosting credentials transferred to client

**What is NOT included:** Ongoing SEO, paid advertising, e-commerce with 100+ products, custom web applications, content writing beyond the strategy session, stock photography (client provides or approves selections).

**Required Client Inputs:**

- Business information (name, services, location, differentiators)
- 5-10 photos (team, location, work -- or approval of stock selections)
- Logo (or approval of a simple wordmark Marcin creates)
- 60 minutes for the content session (Week 1)
- 30 minutes for the review call (end of Week 2)
- Domain access and hosting credentials (or Marcin sets up Vercel/Netlify)

**Profit Margin Analysis:**

| Component | Hours | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Content strategy session + copy drafting | 3 hrs | Interview-based, AI-assisted first draft |
| Design (wireframe + visual design) | 6 hrs | Component library reuse, AI layout assist |
| Development (Next.js/React build) | 10 hrs | Boilerplate + component library, AI code generation |
| Google Business Profile + Analytics setup | 1.5 hrs | Templated process |
| QA, testing, deployment | 2 hrs | Automated testing + manual review |
| Client review + revisions (1 round) | 2 hrs | |
| 30-day check-in call | 0.5 hrs | |
| **Total delivery time** | **25 hrs** | |
| **Effective hourly rate** | **$200/hr** | |

**AI leverage savings:** Pre-AI, an equivalent site build took 60-80 hours at an agency. With AI-assisted code generation, component library reuse, and AI-drafted copy from the content session, Marcin delivers in 25 hours. This is a 60-70% time compression. At the old timeline, $5,000 for 70 hours = $71/hr. At the new timeline, $5,000 for 25 hours = $200/hr. The AI leverage is the entire margin story.

**How many per month to hit target:**

| Scenario | Units/Month | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | Hours/Month |
|----------|:-----------:|----------------:|---------------:|:-----------:|
| Conservative (ramp-up) | 2 | $10,000 | $120,000 | 50 |
| Target | 3 | $15,000 | $180,000 | 75 |
| Full capacity (tight) | 4 | $20,000 | $240,000 | 100 |

At 3 sprints per month, Marcin hits $180K on this product alone. With overlap scheduling (one project in design while another is in development), 3 per month requires ~75 hours of delivery, leaving 85 hours/month for everything else. 4 per month is achievable but leaves almost no margin for sales, admin, or unexpected scope.

### Product 3: Growth On Autopilot (Monthly Retainer)

**One sentence:** "I'm your digital guy -- website maintenance, SEO, optimization, and strategy for a flat monthly fee so you never think about tech again."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Price** | $1,200/month (Tier 1) or $2,500/month (Tier 2) |
| **Commitment** | Month-to-month. Cancel anytime. Keep everything. |
| **Guarantee** | "If any month's work doesn't justify the fee, I refund that month. No questions." |

**Tier 1 -- Keep It Running ($1,200/month):**

1. 6 hours/month of dedicated work
2. Website maintenance, updates, and content changes
3. Monthly performance snapshot (traffic, leads, rankings -- plain English)
4. Google Business Profile management
5. Basic SEO monitoring (ranking tracking for 10 target keywords)
6. 1 strategy call per month (30 minutes)
7. 48-hour response time on requests
8. Priority scheduling for any additional project work

**Tier 2 -- Grow It ($2,500/month):**

Everything in Tier 1, plus:

1. 14 hours/month of dedicated work
2. Active SEO work (content optimization, technical fixes, link building opportunities)
3. 1 new or updated landing page per month
4. A/B testing on key conversion pages
5. Monthly analytics report with specific revenue-impact recommendations
6. Conversion rate optimization (form improvements, CTA testing, page speed)
7. Same-day response time on urgent requests
8. Quarterly strategy session (90 minutes)

**Required Client Inputs:**

- Monthly 30-minute call (or async Loom updates if they prefer)
- Timely responses to content/change requests (within 48 hours)
- Access to analytics, hosting, and any third-party tools

**Profit Margin Analysis:**

| Tier | Hours/Month | Revenue/Month | Effective Rate |
|------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| Tier 1 | 6 hrs | $1,200 | $200/hr |
| Tier 2 | 14 hrs | $2,500 | $179/hr |

**AI leverage on retainers:** Monthly reports are 70% templated. SEO monitoring is tool-automated (Ahrefs/Semrush alerts). Content updates use AI-assisted drafting. The 6 hours in Tier 1 includes ~2 hours of automated/templated work, meaning Marcin's real hands-on time is closer to 4 hours -- pushing the effective rate to $300/hr.

**How many clients to hit target:**

| Client Mix | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|-----------|----------------:|---------------:|
| 6x Tier 1 ($1,200) | $7,200 | $86,400 |
| 4x Tier 1 + 2x Tier 2 | $9,800 | $117,600 |
| 3x Tier 1 + 2x Tier 2 + retainer compounding | $8,600 base + project overflow | $103,200+ |
| 8x Tier 1 | $9,600 | $115,200 |

The retainer is designed to be the revenue floor, not the entire business. At 5-6 retainer clients averaging $1,500/month, the floor is $7,500-$9,000/month ($90K-$108K/year). Everything else -- Website Sprints, Revenue Leak Reports, agency subcontracting -- is upside on top of that floor.

**Retainer acquisition path:** Every Website Sprint client gets a 30-day check-in call. At that call, Marcin presents the retainer as the natural "what happens next." Expected conversion rate: 30-40% of Sprint clients transition to a retainer. At 3 Sprints per month, that is 1-1.2 new retainer clients per month.

**Expected churn:** 10-15% monthly churn (industry average for SMB web retainers). At 10% monthly churn, a client stays an average of 10 months. At $1,200/month, LTV per retainer client = $12,000. At $2,500/month, LTV = $25,000.

## 2. Revenue Models: Three Scenarios

### Model A: Pure Project-Based

All revenue comes from Website Sprints and Revenue Leak Reports. No retainers.

| Offer | Price | Qty/Month | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|-------|------:|:---------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| Revenue Leak Report | $750 | 4 | $3,000 | $36,000 |
| Website in Two Weeks | $5,000 | 2.5 avg | $12,500 | $150,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$15,500** | **$186,000** |

**Pipeline requirements:**

- To close 2.5 Sprints/month at a 25% close rate on qualified calls: 10 qualified calls/month
- To generate 10 qualified calls at 20% conversion from outreach: 50 outreach touches/month minimum
- Revenue Leak Reports at 4/month: approximately 8-10 outreach conversations needed (some convert directly, some come from Sprint inquiry downsells)

**Close rate assumption:** 25% is optimistic for the first 3 months. More realistic in months 1-3: 15-20%. By months 4-6, with case studies and testimonials, 25% is achievable. By month 9+, with referrals flowing, 30%+ is realistic.

**Feast/famine risk:** HIGH. Every month starts at $0. If Marcin gets sick for 2 weeks, a Sprint does not ship. If a month has no closings, revenue is zero. There is no floor.

**Variance analysis:**

| Scenario | Sprints/Mo | Reports/Mo | Monthly | Annual |
|----------|:----------:|:----------:|--------:|-------:|
| Best month | 4 | 6 | $24,500 | -- |
| Average month | 2.5 | 4 | $15,500 | $186,000 |
| Bad month | 1 | 2 | $6,500 | -- |
| Disaster month | 0 | 1 | $750 | -- |

The swing from best to worst month is 33x. This is not a business model -- it is a roller coaster.

**Verdict:** Hits $186K if pipeline stays full. But the variance is brutal. One bad quarter ($19,500 instead of $46,500) and the annual total drops to $160K. Two bad quarters and you are at $133K. Pure project-based is a trap for a solo operator because there is no compounding. Every January 1st, you start at zero again.

---

### Model B: Retainer-Heavy

Prioritize building a retainer base. Projects are secondary, used primarily to create retainer clients.

| Offer | Price | Qty/Clients | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|-------|------:|:-----------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports | $750 | 3/month | $2,250 | $27,000 |
| Website Sprints (converting to retainers) | $5,000 | 1.5/month | $7,500 | $90,000 |
| Growth On Autopilot retainers (steady state) | $1,500 avg | 6 clients | $9,000 | $108,000 |
| **Total at steady state** | | | **$18,750** | **$225,000** |

**Client acquisition timeline:**

| Month | New Retainers Added | Active Retainers | Retainer Revenue/Mo |
|-------|:-------------------:|:----------------:|--------------------:|
| 1-2 | 0 | 0 | $0 |
| 3-4 | 1 | 1 | $1,200-$1,500 |
| 5-6 | 1-2 | 2-3 | $2,400-$4,500 |
| 7-9 | 1-2 per quarter | 3-4 (minus churn) | $3,600-$6,000 |
| 10-12 | 1-2 per quarter | 4-6 (minus churn) | $4,800-$9,000 |
| 13-18 | 1 per quarter | 5-7 (minus churn) | $6,000-$10,500 |

**Churn assumptions:**

- Monthly churn rate: 10% (industry average, conservative)
- Average retention: 10 months
- Annual churn: 35% of retainer base needs replacing
- At 6 clients, that means replacing 2 clients per year to maintain the base

**LTV analysis:**

| Tier | Monthly | Avg Retention | LTV | Acquisition Cost (time) |
|------|--------:|:------------:|----:|:-----------------------:|
| Tier 1 | $1,200 | 10 months | $12,000 | Sprint + conversion call (~1 hr) |
| Tier 2 | $2,500 | 12 months | $30,000 | Sprint + 3 months Tier 1 + upgrade |

**Revenue floor calculation:**

At 6 retainer clients averaging $1,500/month:
- Monthly floor: $9,000
- Annual floor: $108,000
- This covers 60% of the $180K target before any project work

**Verdict:** The retainer base takes 12-18 months to build to 6 clients. Year 1 revenue is lower than Model A ($160K-$175K vs. $186K) because the retainer ramp is slow. But Year 2 is dramatically better: $200K-$225K with a $9,000/month floor. The revenue floor is the key advantage. At $9,000/month guaranteed, Marcin needs only $6,000-$11,000/month from projects to hit target. That is 1-2 Sprints per month -- easily achievable with a warm pipeline.

---

### Model C: Hybrid (Recommended)

The blend of all three products, designed for a realistic ramp from $0 to $15K+ over 6 months. This model also includes agency subcontracting as a bridge income source in months 1-6.

**Steady-State Monthly Revenue (Month 10+):**

| Source | Monthly Revenue | % of Total | Hours/Month |
|--------|----------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports (3/mo) | $2,250 | 12% | 10 |
| Website Sprints (2/mo) | $10,000 | 53% | 50 |
| Growth On Autopilot retainers (4 clients avg) | $6,000 | 32% | 32 |
| Agency subcontracting (residual) | $500-$1,500 | 3% | 5-10 |
| **Total** | **$18,750-$19,750** | **100%** | **97-102** |

**Month-by-Month Ramp (Hybrid Model):**

| Month | Reports | Sprints | Retainers | Agency Sub | **Total** | **Cumulative** |
|:-----:|--------:|--------:|----------:|-----------:|----------:|---------------:|
| 1 | $750 | $0 | $0 | $0 | **$750** | $750 |
| 2 | $1,500 | $2,500 | $0 | $2,000 | **$6,000** | $6,750 |
| 3 | $2,250 | $5,000 | $0 | $4,000 | **$11,250** | $18,000 |
| 4 | $2,250 | $7,500 | $1,200 | $4,000 | **$14,950** | $32,950 |
| 5 | $3,000 | $10,000 | $2,400 | $3,000 | **$18,400** | $51,350 |
| 6 | $2,250 | $5,000 | $3,600 | $3,000 | **$13,850** | $65,200 |
| 7 | $3,000 | $10,000 | $4,800 | $2,000 | **$19,800** | $85,000 |
| 8 | $2,250 | $10,000 | $4,800 | $2,000 | **$19,050** | $104,050 |
| 9 | $3,000 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $1,500 | **$20,500** | $124,550 |
| 10 | $2,250 | $10,000 | $6,000 | $1,000 | **$19,250** | $143,800 |
| 11 | $2,250 | $10,000 | $7,200 | $1,000 | **$20,450** | $164,250 |
| 12 | $3,000 | $10,000 | $7,200 | $500 | **$20,700** | $184,950 |

**Year 1 Summary (Hybrid Model):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Year 1 Revenue** | **$184,950** |
| Revenue from Reports | $27,750 (15%) |
| Revenue from Sprints | $90,000 (49%) |
| Revenue from Retainers | $43,200 (23%) |
| Revenue from Agency Sub | $24,000 (13%) |
| **Month 12 Run Rate (annualized)** | **$248,400** |
| Revenue Floor at Month 12 (retainers only) | $7,200/mo = $86,400/yr |
| Break-even month | Month 3-4 (at ~$8,700/mo threshold) |

**Cash Flow Projection (Hybrid Model):**

| Month | Revenue | Operating Costs | Tax Set-Aside (37%) | Net Cash | Cumulative Net |
|:-----:|--------:|----------------:|--------------------:|---------:|---------------:|
| 1 | $750 | $1,500 | $278 | -$1,028 | -$1,028 |
| 2 | $6,000 | $1,500 | $2,220 | $2,280 | $1,252 |
| 3 | $11,250 | $1,500 | $4,163 | $5,588 | $6,839 |
| 4 | $14,950 | $1,500 | $5,532 | $7,919 | $14,758 |
| 5 | $18,400 | $1,500 | $6,808 | $10,092 | $24,850 |
| 6 | $13,850 | $1,500 | $5,125 | $7,226 | $32,075 |

After month 3, cash flow is positive every month. The dip in month 6 is intentional -- project timing is lumpy. The retainer base provides stability even in low-Sprint months.

---

### Model Comparison

| Metric | Model A (Project) | Model B (Retainer) | Model C (Hybrid) |
|--------|-------------------:|-------------------:|------------------:|
| Year 1 Revenue | $186,000 | $165,000 | $184,950 |
| Year 2 Revenue (projected) | $186,000 | $225,000 | $230,000+ |
| Revenue Floor (Month 12) | $0/mo | $9,000/mo | $7,200/mo |
| % Recurring | 0% | 58% | 23% (growing to 40%+) |
| Variance (best vs worst month) | 33x | 3x | 4x |
| Feast/Famine Risk | Extreme | Low | Low-Medium |
| Sales Effort Required | Very High (constant) | Medium (decreasing) | High then Medium |
| Path to $240K | Very difficult | Achievable Year 2 | Achievable Year 2 |
| Risk of Burnout | High | Low | Medium |

**Recommendation: Model C (Hybrid)**

It hits $180K in Year 1 while building the retainer foundation that makes Year 2 dramatically easier. The agency subcontracting bridge provides income stability during the ramp. By Month 12, the retainer base covers $7,200/month -- enough to survive even if zero projects close for an entire month.

## 3. Pricing Architecture

### The Psychological Price Ceiling for SMB Web Work

Based on behavioral economics research (see supporting docs: offer-research-psychology.md) and market data:

| SMB Revenue Range | Max They Will Pay (Project) | Max They Will Pay (Monthly) | Decision Maker |
|-------------------|----------------------------:|----------------------------:|:--------------:|
| < $500K/yr | $1,000-$3,000 | $300-$800 | Owner (emotional, cash-strapped) |
| $500K-$2M/yr | $3,000-$10,000 | $800-$2,000 | Owner (pragmatic, budget-aware) |
| $2M-$10M/yr | $8,000-$25,000 | $1,500-$5,000 | Owner or Marketing Director |
| $10M+/yr | $15,000-$50,000+ | $3,000-$10,000 | Marketing Director or VP |

**Sweet spot for Nice Right:** Businesses doing $1M-$5M/year. They have budget ($5K-$15K is manageable), they lack in-house digital capability, and the owner still makes the buying decision. At $5,000 for a Website Sprint, Marcin is firmly in the "no-brainer" zone for a $2M business -- it is less than they spend on a week of payroll.

### Where AI Leverage Creates Margin

This is the core financial insight of the entire business model.

| Metric | Pre-AI (Agency Era) | Post-AI (Solo + Claude) | Advantage |
|--------|--------------------:|------------------------:|:---------:|
| Hours for full site build | 60-80 hrs | 20-30 hrs | 3x faster |
| Hours for website audit | 8-10 hrs | 3-4 hrs | 2.5x faster |
| Hours for monthly retainer work | 12-18 hrs | 6-10 hrs | 2x faster |
| Effective hourly rate at $5K project | $63-$83/hr | $167-$250/hr | 3x higher margin |
| Effective hourly rate at $10K project | $125-$167/hr | $333-$500/hr | 3x higher margin |
| Max projects per month (solo) | 1-1.5 | 3-4 | 2-3x more volume |

**The unfair advantage:** Agencies charge $15K-$40K for a comparable site because they have 3-5 people touching every project plus overhead (office, PMs, account managers, benefits). Marcin charges $5K and still makes $200/hr because AI compresses his delivery time by 60-70%. The client gets agency-quality work at freelancer price. Marcin gets freelancer-level overhead at agency-level effective rates. Everyone wins except the agencies.

### Cost Analysis: What a Typical Project Actually Costs Marcin

| Cost Component | Per Project | Notes |
|----------------|:----------:|-------|
| Direct labor (25 hrs at $0 -- it's his time) | $0 | Solo, no payroll |
| AI tools (Claude, Cursor, etc.) | $5-$10 | Amortized monthly subscription |
| Hosting/deployment (Vercel) | $0-$2 | Free tier or minimal overage |
| Design tools (Figma) | $3-$5 | Amortized monthly |
| Analytics tools (for audits) | $10-$15 | Ahrefs/Semrush amortized |
| Communication tools (Cal.com, Zoom) | $2-$3 | Amortized monthly |
| **Total direct cost per project** | **$20-$35** | |
| **Gross margin on $5,000 Sprint** | **$4,965-$4,980** | **99.3-99.6%** |

The gross margin is absurd. This is the power of a knowledge business with no physical goods, no employees, and AI-leveraged production. The only real "cost" is Marcin's time, and the business question is whether that time is allocated to the highest-value activities.

### Value-Based vs. Time-Based vs. Competitor Anchoring

**Should Marcin price based on value, time, or competition?**

The answer is: value-based, using competitor anchoring as the trust mechanism.

- **Value-based pricing** means the $5K Sprint is priced relative to what it produces for the client (more customers, more revenue), not relative to how many hours it takes. If a plumber's average job is worth $800, and the new website generates 5 additional leads per month (converting 3), that is $2,400/month in new revenue. $5K pays for itself in 2 months. The price is a bargain relative to value.

- **Competitor anchoring** means Marcin positions against agencies ($15K-$40K for the same work) and against cheap freelancers ($500-$2,000 for low-quality work). The messaging: "Agency quality at a fraction of the cost, but unlike the $500 Fiverr site, this one actually works."

- **Time-based pricing should never be visible.** The effective rate of $200/hr is an internal metric. If Marcin ever quotes hourly, the client's brain goes: "$200/hr x 40 hours = I should ask for 20 hours instead." Fixed pricing eliminates this negotiation entirely.

### Monthly Payment Plans vs. Lump Sum

Research from behavioral economics (Gourville's "Pennies-a-Day" strategy, Prelec & Loewenstein on mental coupling) shows monthly framing increases purchase intent by 20-50% for the same total.

**Recommendation for the $5,000 Sprint:**

- **Primary framing:** "$2,500 to start, $2,500 at launch" (milestone-based)
- **Alternative framing for price-sensitive buyers:** "3 payments of $1,700" or "$417/month for 12 months" (note: only use if needed to close)
- **Never frame as hourly.** "$5,000 flat" is always the stated price. Payment terms are a financing option, not a price reduction.

**For retainers ($1,200/month):**

- Monthly is already the natural framing. No change needed.
- Do not offer discounts for annual prepayment. The "fire me any month" positioning is more valuable than the cash flow benefit of annual contracts. It communicates confidence and reduces buyer anxiety.

## 4. Capacity Model

### Maximum Concurrent Projects (Solo + AI)

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|:----------:|-------|
| Website Sprint delivery (active builds) | 12-18 | 1-2 active Sprints at any time |
| Revenue Leak Reports | 3-4 | ~1 per week |
| Retainer client work | 6-10 | 4-6 clients at various tiers |
| **Total delivery hours** | **21-32** | |

### Realistic Hours/Week Available

| Category | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|:----------:|-------|
| Gross working time | 40 | Target, not max |
| Sales & business development | 6-8 | Looms, calls, follow-ups, proposals |
| Admin (invoicing, contracts, bookkeeping) | 2-3 | Batch weekly |
| Marketing (content, LinkedIn, networking) | 2-3 | LinkedIn posts, 1 blog/month |
| Learning & tool maintenance | 1-2 | Staying current on AI tools, Next.js, etc. |
| **Total non-billable** | **11-16** | |
| **Available for delivery** | **24-29** | |

**The honest math:** Marcin has ~25 hours per week for billable work. Not 40. Accounting for vacation (2 weeks), holidays (8 days), and sick/off days (5 days), that is approximately 46 working weeks per year = 1,150 billable hours per year.

### Optimal Project Mix Per Month (Steady State)

| Product | Units/Month | Hours/Month | Revenue/Month |
|---------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports | 3 | 10 | $2,250 |
| Website Sprints | 2 | 50 | $10,000 |
| Growth On Autopilot retainers (5 clients) | 5 | 35 | $7,500 |
| Spare capacity for overflow | -- | 5-10 | -- |
| **Total** | | **100-105** | **$19,750** |

At 100-105 hours/month and 25 hours/week, this is achievable with 1 week of buffer per month. The buffer is critical -- it absorbs scope creep, sick days, and the occasional bad week.

### When to Hire/Subcontract

| Revenue Level | Signal | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| $15K/month consistently | Turning away Sprint clients | Consider a part-time dev contractor for overflow |
| $20K/month consistently | Retainer work consuming >40 hrs/month | Hire a part-time VA for retainer maintenance tasks |
| $25K/month consistently | Every week is at 100% utilization | Bring on a junior developer (part-time or contract) |
| $30K+/month | Cannot grow without delegation | Full-time hire or systematic subcontracting |

### What to NEVER Delegate (Competitive Advantage)

1. **Strategy calls and client diagnosis.** This is the core skill. Marcin's ability to hear a business owner describe their problem and immediately see the solution is the product. A junior cannot replicate this.
2. **Design decisions.** The enterprise UX training (Northern Trust, DEPT) is what makes the work premium. Design taste and systems thinking cannot be delegated to a $20/hr contractor.
3. **Client communication.** The testimonials all praise Marcin's ability to translate tech into plain English. This IS the brand. The moment a client talks to someone else, the value proposition breaks.
4. **Revenue Leak Report analysis.** The diagnosis is the highest-value, highest-margin activity. Delegate the data pull, never the interpretation.

### What to Delegate FIRST

1. **QA and testing.** Systematic, process-driven, does not require senior judgment. A part-time contractor or automated testing pipeline handles this.
2. **Analytics setup.** GA4 + GTM + Search Console configuration is templated. A junior can follow a checklist.
3. **Content changes on retainer sites.** Updating hours, adding a blog post, swapping a photo -- this is maintenance, not strategy.
4. **Social media scheduling and admin tasks.** Invoicing, contract generation, email scheduling -- all delegatable to a VA.
5. **Initial data pulls for audits.** Running PageSpeed, Ahrefs crawl, competitor screenshots -- process work that feeds the analysis.

### KPIs to Track (Weekly)

| KPI | Definition | Target (Month 1-3) | Target (Month 4-6) | Target (Month 7+) |
|-----|-----------|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
| **Outreach volume** | Looms + emails + LinkedIn DMs sent | 80+/week | 60+/week | 40+/week |
| **Conversations started** | Responses to outreach | 10+/week | 8+/week | 6+/week |
| **Discovery calls completed** | Strategy calls held | 3-4/week | 3-4/week | 2-3/week |
| **Proposals sent** | Revenue Leak Reports + Sprint proposals | 2-3/week | 2-3/week | 2/week |
| **Deals closed** | Paid engagements signed | 1-2/month | 2-4/month | 3-5/month |
| **Revenue** | Cash received | $3K-$10K/mo | $12K-$20K/mo | $15K-$25K/mo |
| **Active retainer clients** | Paying monthly clients | 0-1 | 2-4 | 4-6 |
| **Pipeline value** | Total value of active proposals | $10K-$20K | $20K-$40K | $30K-$50K |

### Lead-to-Close Conversion Benchmarks

| Stage | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|-------|:--------------:|-------|
| Outreach touch --> Response | 15-30% (Loom), 3-5% (cold email) | Loom is 5-10x higher than text-only |
| Response --> Discovery call | 30-50% | Higher if Loom demonstrated competence |
| Discovery call --> Proposal sent | 60-70% | Most calls should result in a next step |
| Proposal --> Closed deal | 25-40% | Varies by offer; Reports close higher than Sprints |
| Sprint client --> Retainer | 30-40% | Driven by the 30-day check-in conversation |
| **End-to-end: Outreach --> Revenue** | **2-5%** | At 100 touches/month, that is 2-5 new clients |

### Revenue Per Hour Targets

| Activity | Target $/hr | Red Flag Below |
|----------|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports | $230+ | $150 |
| Website Sprints | $200+ | $125 |
| Retainer work (Tier 1) | $200+ | $120 |
| Retainer work (Tier 2) | $180+ | $100 |
| Agency subcontract | $100-$125 | $75 |
| **Blended average (all work)** | **$180+** | **$130** |

If the blended average drops below $130/hr, something is wrong -- either prices are too low, projects are taking too long (scope creep), or too much time is going to low-value agency work.

### Monthly Minimums and Stretch Goals

| Metric | Minimum (Survive) | Target (Thrive) | Stretch (Accelerate) |
|--------|:------------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| Monthly revenue | $8,700 | $15,000-$20,000 | $25,000+ |
| New clients acquired | 1 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Retainer clients (active) | 2 | 4-6 | 7+ |
| Effective hourly rate | $130/hr | $180/hr | $230/hr |
| Utilization (billable/total) | 50% | 60-65% | 70%+ |

### "Red Flag" Thresholds

These are signals that something needs to change immediately:

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Revenue below $8,700 for 2 consecutive months | Cannot cover living expenses + taxes | Cut all non-essential spending. Double outreach volume. Consider founding-rate projects to generate cash. |
| Zero discovery calls in a week | Outreach has stopped or targeting is wrong | Audit outreach quality. Are Looms being sent? Are they to the right businesses? Restart the daily habit. |
| Close rate below 10% over 2 months | Offer or sales conversation is broken | Record a sales call (with permission) and review. Is the diagnostic being presented? Is ROI being framed? Is the guarantee being mentioned? |
| Retainer churn above 20% in a month | Clients not seeing value | Call every churning client. Ask specifically what was missing. Audit the monthly deliverables. Are reports going out? Are recommendations being implemented? |
| Effective hourly rate below $130 | Projects taking too long or prices too low | Track actual hours on next 3 projects. Is AI being used effectively? Is scope creeping? Raise prices on next proposal by 15%. |
| More than 50% revenue from agency subcontracting after Month 9 | Direct client pipeline is not building | Reduce agency hours by 25%. Redirect that time to outreach. The agency work is a crutch. |
| Working more than 45 hours/week consistently | Approaching burnout, unsustainable | Something needs to be delegated or a client needs to be let go. Audit time allocation. |

---

### Weeks 1-2: Warm Network Blitz + First Revenue Target

**Goal:** 3 paid engagements by Day 14. Revenue target: $1,500-$3,750.

**Day 1-2: Build the outreach list**
- List every professional contact from 13 years: Comrade, DEPT/Melon, Northern Trust, MDRT, Sparkblox, personal network
- Target: 50+ names minimum
- Categorize: (A) People who own/run businesses, (B) People who know business owners, (C) Former colleagues at agencies

**Day 1-3: Send 50 personal messages**

To business owners in your network:
> "Hey [Name] -- I've gone independent after 13 years in digital/web. I'm offering a free 20-minute strategy call to people in my network. I'll look at your online presence and give you honest feedback on what's working and what's costing you customers. Even if we never work together, you'll walk away with something useful. Interested?"

To former colleagues:
> "Hey [Name] -- I've started my own practice. If your agency/team ever has overflow or you run into someone who needs web/digital help, I'd love to be the person you send them to. How's everything going?"

**Expected results from 50 messages:**
- 20-30 responses
- 8-12 "let's talk" or "I know someone"
- 3-5 strategy calls booked

**Day 3-4: LinkedIn announcement**
One post. Personal, honest, clear. Include the niceright.co URL. Tag former employers and colleagues (respectfully). Share the "100+ projects, 13 years, now independent" narrative.

**Day 5-14: Loom Blitz begins**
- Record 4 personalized Loom videos per day reviewing local business websites
- Target industries: home services, restaurants, dental/medical, professional services
- Send each with a short email: "I noticed a few things on your site. Recorded a quick video. No strings."
- Volume by Day 14: 40 Looms sent

**Week 1-2 Revenue Target:**
- 2-3 Revenue Leak Reports at $750 (or $500 founding rate) = $1,000-$2,250
- OR 1 founding-rate Sprint engagement (deposit of $2,500)
- Target: $1,500-$3,750 by Day 14

**Week 1-2 Founding Client Strategy:**
For the first 3 clients, offer:
> "I'm building my independent practice and looking for 3 founding clients. You get senior-level work at 30% off my standard rate. I get a case study and testimonial. Fair trade?"

This is honest, creates urgency (only 3 spots), and reframes the "I have no clients" reality as an opportunity.

---

### Weeks 3-4: First Revenue + First Sprint Client

**Goal:** First $5,000+ engagement signed. Total revenue by Day 30: $5,000-$10,000.

**Daily routine established:**
- 8:00-10:00 AM: Outreach (Looms, emails, follow-ups) -- NON-NEGOTIABLE
- 10:00 AM-12:00 PM: Client work (Reports, Sprint delivery)
- 1:00-4:00 PM: Client work + sales calls (schedule calls in this block)
- 4:00-5:00 PM: Follow-ups, proposals, admin

**Week 3 activities:**
- Continue Loom outreach (4/day)
- Follow up on all Week 1-2 conversations (Day 3 and Day 10 follow-up cadence)
- Conduct discovery calls using the framework: Situation (5 min) --> Problem Amplification (5 min) --> Vision + Credibility (5 min) --> Close (5 min)
- Send first Sprint proposals
- Begin agency subcontractor outreach: reach out to 10-15 agencies (Comrade network, Clutch.co listings, LinkedIn searches)

**Week 4 activities:**
- Close first Sprint engagement (target: $5,000 at founding rate or $5,000 standard)
- Begin delivering first Revenue Leak Reports
- Document everything for case study: screenshots of "before" state, analytics baseline, competitor landscape
- Follow up on agency outreach -- aim for 2-3 agency conversations

**Day 30 targets:**
- 50+ warm outreach messages sent
- 40+ Loom videos sent
- 10-15 conversations in progress
- 5-8 discovery calls completed
- 2-3 Revenue Leak Reports delivered
- 1 Sprint engagement signed (or in final negotiation)
- 1-2 agency conversations in progress
- **Revenue: $5,000-$10,000** (committed or collected)

**If these numbers are not met by Day 30, diagnose:**
1. Volume problem (not enough outreach) -- double the Looms
2. Targeting problem (wrong businesses) -- shift to higher-revenue businesses
3. Offer problem (not compelling enough) -- lower founding rate, add guarantee language
4. Sales conversation problem -- record a call (with permission), review, adjust

---

### Month 2: First Projects Deliver, Pipeline Builds

**Goal:** $8,000-$15,000 in revenue. First Sprint delivered. First case study data collected.

**Week 5-6:**
- Deliver first Website Sprint(s)
- First agency subcontract project begins ($2,000-$4,000)
- Continue Loom outreach (reduce to 3/day as client work increases)
- Launch cold email domain warming (buy a secondary domain, send 5-10 emails/day to warm contacts for 2 weeks)

**Week 7-8:**
- Complete first Sprint and conduct 30-day check-in call
- At check-in, introduce the retainer: "Your site is performing well. Here's what I'd do over the next 3 months to keep the momentum. Most clients move into a monthly partnership at this point."
- Collect first testimonial (specific, outcome-focused: "What result did you see?")
- Start writing the first independent case study
- Cold email sequences begin (20/day after warm-up)
- If agency relationship activated, agency work provides $3,000-$5,000/month

**Month 2 Revenue Target:**

| Source | Revenue |
|--------|--------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports (2-3) | $1,500-$2,250 |
| Website Sprint delivery (1) | $5,000-$7,500 |
| Agency subcontracting | $2,000-$4,000 |
| **Total** | **$8,500-$13,750** |

---

### Month 3: Scaling What Works, First Retainer

**Goal:** $10,000-$18,000 in revenue. First retainer client signed. Pipeline self-sustaining.

**Key activities:**
- Convert first Sprint client to Growth On Autopilot retainer ($1,200/month)
- Publish first independent case study on niceright.co (the 290% traffic story if from agency era, or the first independent project results)
- Raise prices from founding rates to standard rates (Revenue Leak Report goes to $750 if it was discounted; Sprint stays at $5,000)
- Agency subcontracting is now steady at $3,000-$5,000/month
- Begin building referral partner relationships: identify 5 local accountants, business coaches, or complementary service providers. Send personal outreach. Offer coffee meetings.
- Outreach cadence stabilizes: 60-80 touches/week (mix of Loom, email, LinkedIn)
- Pipeline should have 5-10 active conversations at any time

**Month 3 Revenue Target:**

| Source | Revenue |
|--------|--------:|
| Revenue Leak Reports (3-4) | $2,250-$3,000 |
| Website Sprints (1-2) | $5,000-$10,000 |
| Retainer revenue (1 client) | $1,200 |
| Agency subcontracting | $3,000-$5,000 |
| **Total** | **$11,450-$19,200** |

**Milestone check:** If Month 3 revenue exceeds $10,000, the business model is validated. Proceed to scaling. If below $8,700 (break-even), something fundamental needs adjustment -- likely outreach volume or close rate.

---

### Month 3 Milestone: Hitting $10K+

At the end of Month 3, the business should look like this:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active retainer clients | 1 |
| Completed Sprints | 3-5 |
| Revenue Leak Reports delivered | 8-12 |
| Agency relationships active | 1-2 |
| Pipeline conversations | 5-10 at any time |
| Monthly revenue run rate | $12,000-$18,000 |
| First independent case study | Published |
| First independent testimonial | Collected |
| Cash runway consumed | $5,000-$8,000 (months 1-2 deficit) |

---

### 90-Day Summary: The Money Map

| Week | Primary Activity | Revenue Action | Target Revenue (Cumulative) |
|:----:|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------:|
| 1 | Warm network activation (50 messages) | Book 3-5 strategy calls | $0 |
| 2 | Loom blitz begins (40 videos) | Close 2-3 founding Rate Reports | $1,000-$2,250 |
| 3 | Discovery calls + proposals | Sign first Sprint client | $3,500-$5,000 |
| 4 | Deliver first Reports, start Sprint | Agency outreach begins | $5,000-$10,000 |
| 5-6 | Deliver first Sprint | Agency first project | $13,500-$23,000 |
| 7-8 | Check-in call, introduce retainer | Collect testimonial, write case study | $22,000-$37,000 |
| 9-10 | Sign first retainer, raise prices | Referral partner outreach | $33,000-$56,000 |
| 11-12 | Publish case study, pipeline compounds | Close standard-rate Sprint | $44,000-$75,000 |
| **Day 90** | | | **$44,000-$75,000** |

**The realistic Day 90 number is $50,000-$60,000 cumulative.** This puts Marcin on a $200K-$240K annualized run rate if the momentum continues, which is exactly the target range.

## Appendix: What Does NOT Pencil Out

These are the scenarios and strategies that the math does not support. Documenting them here to avoid wasted time.

1. **$240K in Year 1 from zero clients.** The ramp from zero takes 2-3 months. The realistic Year 1 ceiling is $185K-$200K. $240K requires a Year 2 retainer base.

2. **Pure hourly billing at $150/hr to hit $180K.** At 1,000 billable hours/year, that is $150K. Below target. Hourly billing also eliminates the AI leverage advantage -- the faster Marcin works, the less he earns.

3. **More than 6-7 retainer clients while also doing Sprints.** 7 retainer clients at an average of 8 hours/month = 56 hours/month on retainers alone. That leaves 44 hours/month for Sprints (less than 2 per month) and zero hours for sales. The solo capacity ceiling is 5-6 retainers + 2 Sprints/month.

4. **$500 diagnostics as a significant revenue stream.** Even at 10 per month (unrealistic volume), that is $5,000/month. It is a pipeline tool, not a revenue center. Price it at $750 and focus on conversion to Sprints.

5. **Competing on price against offshore teams or AI builders.** A $1,500 website from a Ukrainian team or an AI-generated Framer site will always be cheaper. Marcin competes on judgment, communication, and business results -- not on the website itself.

6. **Selling $3,000/month retainers to Cleveland SMBs doing under $1M.** The math does not work for the buyer. A $36K/year digital retainer is 3.6% of a $1M business's gross revenue. Most SMBs allocate 5-10% to all marketing. The retainer would consume 36-72% of their marketing budget. Target $2M+ businesses for Tier 2 retainers.

7. **Building an audience/content strategy as the primary lead gen in the first 6 months.** Content compounds over 12-24 months. Outreach converts in 2-6 weeks. Do outreach now, build content in parallel, and let the content take over in Year 2.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How many billable hours/year? | ~1,150 (25 hrs/wk x 46 weeks) |
| What effective rate for $180K? | $157/hr (achievable with productized offers at $180-$230 effective) |

| Break-even month? | Month 3-4 at ~$8,700/month |
| Cash runway needed? | $15K-$20K for months 1-2 |
| When is $15K/month consistent? | Month 5-6 |
| When is $20K/month consistent? | Month 9-12 |
| Path to $240K? | Year 2 with 6 retainer clients ($9K/mo floor) + 2 Sprints/month ($10K/mo) + overflow |
| What must happen first? | 50 warm outreach messages this week. Not next week. This week. |
