## 1. Category Design

### The problem with the current category

The site currently places Marcin in the category of **"Freelance Web Developer for Small Businesses."** This is one of the most crowded categories in the services economy. The competitive set includes millions of freelancers on Upwork, Fiverr, and Toptal; every local web design shop in every metro area; every Squarespace/Wix/Webflow template builder; every "full-stack developer" who also does design and SEO; every agency that offers SMB packages; every nephew, cousin, and friend-of-a-friend who "knows computers"; and, increasingly, AI website builders that can produce a professional-looking site in minutes for under $100.

The current homepage headline is: **"Grow your business. We'll handle the tech."** The meta title is: "Websites, Apps & Digital Growth for Small Businesses." The footer says: "Digital growth for small businesses."

Translated into a positioning statement, the current position is:

> "Nice Right is a freelance web developer / digital consultant who builds websites, apps, and digital tools for small businesses."

This is commodity positioning. It describes what thousands of people do. It differentiates on degree (more experience, better quality) but not on kind (fundamentally different offering). It competes on execution, not insight. It anchors to deliverables (websites, apps, tools) rather than outcomes (revenue, leads, time saved). And it takes a genuinely rare combination of skills and compresses them into the most generic possible description.

### What Marcin should STOP saying

**Stop saying "web designer" or "web developer."** These titles are death for premium positioning. They invite comparison with $15/hr freelancers and automated site builders. Never use these as a primary title in any context.

**Stop saying "everything your business needs online."** While intended to communicate breadth, it signals "I do not specialize in anything." The buyer thinks: "If he does everything, he probably does nothing great."

**Stop saying "affordable" or comparing down to agencies.** The site currently says "Agencies charge $15,000-$40,000 for the same scope." This is a smart comparison for communicating value, but it must be used to signal "same quality, better structure" -- never "same thing, cheaper." Competing on price invites a price war with Fiverr and offshore teams.

**Stop saying "AI-powered" or leading with AI tools.** In 2026, every competitor claims to use AI. It is not a differentiator -- it is table stakes. Mentioning AI in positioning commoditizes the human expertise that is actually valuable.

**Stop saying "digital solutions," "innovative," "tailored," "bespoke," "holistic," "end-to-end," or "transformative."** These words have been destroyed by overuse. They communicate nothing and signal that the speaker has nothing specific to say.

### The unique combination nobody else has

Before designing a category, we need to map what is actually rare about Marcin's background. Individual skills are common. The intersection of all five circles is not.

**Circle 1: Volume SMB Experience (100+ projects at Comrade).** Not just "I have worked with small businesses" but "I have seen the same patterns across 100+ of them." He has pattern recognition that a freelancer with 10 projects does not have. He has seen what works and what wastes money -- at scale.

**Circle 2: Enterprise-Grade UX and Systems Thinking.** Northern Trust micro-interaction systems, GSAP animation, Vue.js components, design system integration. DEPT/Melon UX Design Lead. MDRT UX consultant. This is not "I can make things pretty." This is systems-level thinking about how users interact with digital products.

**Circle 3: Full-Stack Technical Execution.** Can design in Figma AND code in React/Next.js AND set up analytics AND configure SEO AND automate workflows. Most designers cannot code. Most coders cannot design. Most of neither can do strategy. The "triple threat" (design + code + strategy) is genuinely rare at a senior level.

**Circle 4: Business and Product Thinking.** Co-founded Sparkblox, raised $1M, operated for 2 years. Failed, but learned how businesses actually work -- unit economics, fundraising, product-market fit, hiring, burn rate. Product Lead at GreenPill Dev Guild -- not just executing a design brief, but defining the product vision, success metrics, and feature prioritization.

**Circle 5: Translation Ability.** Every testimonial mentions this. "Breaking down industry terms for clients." "Decipher what we wanted despite inadequate information." "Goes above and beyond with recommendations." This is the ability to sit in the gap between a business owner who does not speak tech and a technical system that needs to be built -- and translate in both directions. This is not a soft skill. It is a strategic capability.

### The "Only" statement

Most people who can work at the Northern Trust level do not choose to work with plumbers and restaurants. Most people who work with plumbers and restaurants cannot work at the Northern Trust level. Most people who do either have never started a company, raised money, and learned what breaks a business from the inside. And almost none of them can explain what they are doing in plain English to a non-technical person.

> **"The only digital strategist in the Midwest who has built 100+ small business websites, designed enterprise systems for Northern Trust, co-founded a venture-backed startup, and personally handles strategy, design, and code -- so you get one senior person instead of five junior ones."**

This is the honest differentiator. It is not about any single skill. It is about the breadth of the stack combined with the depth of SMB-specific experience, delivered by a single person who speaks both languages.

### The category Marcin should OWN

**Category: Digital Growth Architect**

The frame: Your business does not need a website. It needs a digital growth system -- an interconnected set of assets (site, SEO, automation, analytics, customer experience) that work together to bring in customers, save time, and keep people coming back. A "web developer" builds one piece. A Digital Growth Architect designs and builds the whole system.

Why "architect" works:

- **It implies design-level thinking plus technical execution.** Nobody hires a bricklayer to design a building. If your digital presence is your storefront, you need an architect, not a laborer.
- **"Growth" is the outcome, not "digital" or "web."** It names what the client actually wants.
- **It differentiates from every competitive set.** A "web developer" builds one thing. A "marketing consultant" advises but does not build. An "agency" has multiple people, none of whom see the whole picture. An "architect" designs the whole system and can also build it.
- **It justifies higher pricing.** Architects charge more than contractors because their work determines whether the project succeeds or fails.
- **It leads to the right offer structure.** An architect starts with a blueprint (Growth Audit / diagnostic), then builds (project), then maintains (retainer). The offer ladder is built into the category name.
- **It is unoccupied.** Nobody in the Cleveland or broader Midwest SMB market is using this exact positioning with this level of credibility behind it.

The brand promise that sits on top of the category:

> **"The last web hire you'll make."**

This is not a category title. It is the emotional position. It directly addresses the dominant buyer emotion: fear of being ripped off again. The "Sound familiar?" section on the site already names this pain -- the agency that charged $20K for a template, the freelancer who vanished, the DIY builder that nobody found on Google. "The Last Web Hire" turns that empathy into a positioning claim. It creates a natural filter: this is not for people shopping for the cheapest option. It is for people who have tried the cheap option and are done with it.

### How the unfair advantage works

The unfair advantage is the specific combination operating at a specific market:

| Asset | What it means for the client |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 100+ SMB projects | "He has seen my exact problem before. He is not guessing." |
| Enterprise UX (Northern Trust) | "He builds things at a level most freelancers cannot touch." |
| Full-stack execution | "One person. No telephone game. No 'that is not my department.'" |
| Startup founder (Sparkblox) | "He understands my business, not just my website." |
| Translation ability | "He explains things I actually understand." |
| AI leverage (3-5x speed) | "He delivers in 2 weeks what takes others 2 months." |

The AI leverage deserves special attention. Marcin is not positioning as "AI-powered." He is using AI as an operational accelerator that lets him deliver enterprise-grade work at solo-operator speed. The client does not care about the tools. They care about the results and the timeline. The AI advantage manifests as: faster delivery, lower price than agencies (because no overhead), and more hours spent on strategy rather than production. This is a real differentiator right now because most consultants in 2026 are either (a) not using AI effectively or (b) using it as a marketing gimmick rather than as genuine operational leverage.

## 2. Ideal Client Profile

### The ONE type of buyer where Marcin's background is a perfect fit

**Owner-operators of established small businesses doing $500K-$5M in annual revenue, with 2-50 employees, no in-house digital team, and a website that is actively losing them customers.**

This is the person who:

- Has a real business with real revenue. They are past survival mode. They are investing in growth.
- Has been burned before -- by an agency that overcharged, a freelancer who ghosted, or a DIY builder that looked fine until nobody could find them on Google.
- Does not have a marketing director, a CTO, or anyone on staff whose job is "digital." The owner makes these decisions themselves, often with dread.
- Has a website that exists but is not working. It is not generating leads, it is not ranking on Google, it is not converting visitors, or it looks like it was built in 2016 because it was.
- Has budget. At $500K-$5M revenue, $5K-$15K for a website project is a real investment but not an existential one. It represents roughly 1-2% of annual revenue, which is within standard digital marketing budget allocation.
- Values directness and honesty over polish and process. They do not want a pitch deck. They want someone who will tell them the truth about what is wrong and fix it.

### Why this buyer, not others

**Below $500K revenue:** Cannot afford $5K-$15K projects. They end up on Squarespace or Fiverr. Marcin's time is worth more, and these clients often require more hand-holding for less revenue.

**Above $5M revenue:** Starting to hire internal teams or work with mid-size agencies. The "one-person digital department" positioning loses relevance when the company already has a marketing director.

**Startups:** Cash-poor, scope-heavy, prone to pivoting mid-project. Marcin has been there with Sparkblox. He knows the dynamic. Unless they are funded (Seed or later) and paying cash, avoid.

**Enterprise direct:** Possible through subcontracting (Northern Trust was exactly this), but enterprise sales cycles are 6-12 months, procurement processes are brutal, and the work is often narrow in scope. Better served through agency subcontract relationships than direct outreach.

### Three buyer personas

#### Persona 1: "Dave the HVAC Guy"

**Name:** Dave Kowalski
**Business:** Kowalski Heating & Cooling, Parma OH
**Revenue:** $1.8M/year, 12 employees (4 techs, 1 office manager, owner)
**Website:** Built 6 years ago by a nephew. Has not been updated. Does not rank for "HVAC repair Cleveland." Mobile experience is broken. No contact form -- just a phone number buried on the About page.
**Digital presence:** 87 Google reviews at 4.6 stars. Strong reputation offline. Invisible online.
**Budget:** Has spent $0 on digital in 3 years. Previously paid a local agency $8K for a site that "never did anything." Skeptical of the entire industry.

**Pain points:**
- "All my business comes from word of mouth and Angi. I know I should be online but every time I try, I get ripped off."
- "My competitor just got a new website and they are showing up everywhere on Google. I am losing jobs to them."
- "I do not know what I do not know. I need someone who can just tell me what to do and do it."

**What Dave needs from Marcin:**
1. Someone who speaks his language, not jargon
2. A clear diagnosis of what is wrong (the 48-Hour Revenue Roadmap)
3. A fixed price with no surprises
4. Proof that this has worked for businesses like his (the 290% traffic / 12x leads case study is from a home service company)
5. A guarantee that reduces his risk

**Where Dave hangs out:**
- Cleveland HVAC contractor association meetings
- Local BNI chapters
- Supply house counters (Ferguson, Johnstone) -- where contractors gossip
- Facebook groups for local trades
- He does NOT read blogs, watch YouTube, or scroll LinkedIn

**How to reach Dave:**
- Loom video reviewing his website, sent cold via email
- Referral from his accountant, insurance agent, or another contractor
- In-person at a trade association event or a BNI meeting
- Google search: "website help for HVAC company Cleveland" (once SEO is built)

#### Persona 2: "Sarah the Multi-Location Dentist"

**Name:** Dr. Sarah Chen
**Business:** Bright Smile Dental, 3 locations in suburban Cleveland
**Revenue:** $3.2M/year, 28 employees (dentists, hygienists, front desk)
**Website:** Decent design from a dental-specific agency 4 years ago. Slow load speed. No online booking. Blog has not been updated in 18 months. Ranks page 2 for most searches.
**Digital presence:** Strong Healthgrades and Google ratings. No active marketing beyond the website.
**Budget:** Currently pays $1,200/month to an SEO agency that sends reports she does not read. Willing to invest more if she understood what she was paying for.

**Pain points:**
- "I am paying for SEO and I have no idea if it is working. I feel like I am throwing money away."
- "Our website does not have online booking. Every new patient has to call. We lose people after hours."
- "I just opened a third location and the website barely mentions it. I need someone who can think about this strategically, not just add a page."

**What Sarah needs from Marcin:**
1. Someone who can audit what she is currently paying for and tell her if it is worth it (Digital Growth Blueprint)
2. Strategic thinking about her multi-location digital presence
3. Modernization: online booking, location pages, speed optimization
4. Ongoing management she can trust so she can focus on dentistry
5. Plain-English reporting that actually tells her something useful

**Where Sarah hangs out:**
- Ohio Dental Association events
- Local dental study clubs
- LinkedIn (she posts occasionally about her practice)
- She reads dental industry publications but not marketing blogs
- Her referral network: other dentists, oral surgeons, orthodontists

**How to reach Sarah:**
- Referral from another dental professional
- LinkedIn message noting specific observations about her website
- Cold email with a competitive analysis showing what her competitors are doing that she is not
- Partnership with a dental CPA or practice management consultant

---

#### Persona 3: "Mike the Growing Contractor"

**Name:** Mike Reyes
**Business:** Reyes Renovations, general contracting / home remodeling, Cleveland Heights
**Revenue:** $950K/year, growing fast, 6 employees plus subcontractors
**Website:** WordPress site that loads in 8 seconds. Template from ThemeForest. Has a blog with 3 posts from 2022. Photos are stock, not actual projects.
**Digital presence:** 42 Google reviews at 4.9 stars. Active on Instagram, posting project photos. No connection between Instagram and website.
**Budget:** Has never spent more than $2K on his website. Is now hitting a growth ceiling and knows digital is the bottleneck. Ready to invest but scared of getting it wrong.

**Pain points:**
- "I get all my leads from Instagram and referrals. But I am maxing out. I need a real web presence to get to the next level."
- "I looked at agencies and they quoted me $25K. That is insane for a company my size. But the cheap freelancers I have talked to do not inspire confidence."
- "I have incredible before/after photos and client testimonials but none of that is on my website. My site does not represent who we actually are."

**What Mike needs from Marcin:**
1. A website that showcases his actual work (not stock photos) and converts visitors into leads
2. SEO to capture "home renovation Cleveland" and related searches
3. Integration with his Instagram content
4. A clear, one-time project with the option for ongoing support
5. Someone who gets that he is a craftsman and treats his digital presence with the same care he treats his renovations

**Where Mike hangs out:**
- Local home builder association meetings
- Instagram (daily user, follows other contractors and design accounts)
- Home shows and local renovation events
- Lumber yards and trade supply counters
- NextDoor (where homeowners discuss contractor recommendations)

**How to reach Mike:**
- Instagram DM noting his great project photos and offering to help his website match his Instagram quality
- Loom video reviewing his site with specific observations
- Referral from a real estate agent, interior designer, or architect
- In-person at a home show or builder association event

### The "if you could only serve one type of client" answer

**Home service contractors doing $1M-$5M.** Here is why:

1. **Marcin already has the case study.** The 290% traffic growth / 12x lead increase is from a home service company at Comrade. This is proven, not theoretical.
2. **The pain is acute.** Home service businesses live and die by lead generation. A website that does not rank or convert directly costs them money every single day.
3. **The budget is there.** A plumbing or HVAC company doing $2M has marketing budget. They are spending money somewhere -- usually on Angi, HomeAdvisor, or truck wraps. Redirecting $10K to a website that generates leads indefinitely is an easy ROI argument.
4. **The market is enormous.** There are approximately 3.5 million home service businesses in the US. Even at the hyper-local level, Cleveland has thousands.
5. **Referrals are strong.** Contractors talk to each other. Plumbers know electricians who know roofers who know landscapers. One good result in this market creates a referral chain.
6. **The competition is weak.** Most "web designers for contractors" are template shops charging $1K-$3K for cookie-cutter WordPress sites. Nobody in this space combines senior UX strategy with full-stack execution and a documented track record.
7. **Marcin knows the industry.** Six years at Comrade meant working with home service companies constantly. He knows their operations, their customers, their seasonal patterns, and their specific digital challenges.

## 3. Messaging Architecture

### Headline (7 words or less)

> **Your website should sell for you.**

Alternative options, ranked:

1. "Your website should sell for you." -- Direct, outcome-focused, implies the current one does not.
2. "The last web hire you'll make." -- Bold brand promise, works as tagline.
3. "Websites that actually bring in customers." -- Plain English, specific outcome.
4. "Stop losing customers to your website." -- Loss aversion, problem-aware.
5. "Built 100+ sites. Yours should work." -- Credential + challenge.

### Subheadline (one sentence)

> **I design and build digital growth systems for small businesses -- the kind that rank on Google, convert visitors into leads, and keep working long after launch day.**

### The "I help" statement

> **I help established small business owners turn their website from a cost into a revenue engine -- without hiring an agency, managing a team, or becoming a tech expert.**

### Three proof points that make him credible

**Proof Point 1: The Volume**
"100+ projects across home services, restaurants, healthcare, e-commerce, and professional services. I have seen every mistake a small business can make online -- and I know exactly what fixes move the needle."

This proof point establishes pattern recognition. It says: I am not experimenting on you. I have done this before. Many times.

**Proof Point 2: The Pedigree**
"I designed animation systems for Northern Trust (Fortune 500), led UX teams at top agencies, and built healthcare platforms that handle multimillion-dollar transactions. You get that same level of thinking applied to your business."

This proof point establishes quality. It says: the work I produce is at a level most freelancers cannot touch, because I trained at a level most freelancers never reach.

**Proof Point 3: The Results**
"290% traffic growth. 12x more leads from the same website. 40% faster deal closing. These are not projections -- they are measured outcomes from real projects I led."

This proof point establishes effectiveness. It says: this is not theory. This is what happened.

### The origin story angle

The narrative that makes Marcin memorable is the **"Michelin chef opens a neighborhood restaurant"** story. The site already gestures toward it in the About section, but it needs to become the core narrative, not a sidebar.

The story, refined:

> I spent years building digital products at the highest level -- designing systems for Fortune 500 banks, leading UX teams at top agencies, co-founding a startup that raised a million dollars (and eventually failed -- which taught me more than the successes did). I was good at it. But I kept noticing the same thing: small businesses were getting the worst deal in tech. Agencies charged them $20K for sites built on $50 templates. Freelancers vanished mid-project. AI tools gave them something that looked fine but converted nobody.
>
> I thought: what if someone who knows how to build at the highest level chose to build at the street level? Not because the work is smaller -- but because the impact is bigger. When Northern Trust's website improves, their stock barely moves. When a plumber's website starts generating 12x more leads, it changes his family's life.
>
> That is why Nice Right exists. Same expertise. Different scale. And instead of five people who each know a slice of what you need, you get one person who knows the whole picture -- and builds it himself.

This story works because:

1. **It explains the career move.** "Why would someone with Fortune 500 experience work with my plumbing company?" The story answers that question before it is asked.
2. **It elevates the small business buyer.** The story does not say "I came down to your level." It says "your problems are harder and more impactful than enterprise problems."
3. **It makes the startup failure an asset.** The Sparkblox story is not a liability -- it is proof that Marcin understands what it means to run a business, not just build websites for them.
4. **It is memorable.** The "Michelin chef / neighborhood restaurant" metaphor is sticky. Someone who hears it can repeat it to a friend at lunch. That is how referrals happen.

---

## 4. Competitive Moat

### How AI leverage changes the positioning

Marcin should never position as "the AI guy." But AI is changing his competitive position in three concrete ways:

**Speed.** What takes a traditional freelancer 6-8 weeks, Marcin delivers in 2-3 weeks. This is not about cutting corners. It is about using AI for the production-heavy work (component scaffolding, content drafting, analytics setup, SEO research) so that more hours go toward strategy and quality. The client gets faster delivery and more thinking per dollar.

**Price vs. agencies.** An agency charges $15K-$40K because they have project managers, account executives, office leases, and junior staff learning on the client's dime. Marcin has none of that overhead. AI replaces the junior team members. The client gets agency-quality output at solo-operator prices -- not because the work is cheaper, but because the delivery model is leaner.

**Scope per engagement.** Where a traditional freelancer might deliver a website, Marcin can deliver a website + SEO setup + analytics dashboard + competitor analysis + content strategy in the same engagement for the same price. AI handles the 80% of each task that is formulaic, freeing Marcin to focus on the 20% that requires human judgment and taste.

The positioning implication: do not mention AI. Demonstrate the results. When a client asks "how do you deliver so fast at this quality?" the answer is: "I use every tool available -- including AI -- to spend more time on strategy and less time on production. You are paying for my 13 years of judgment, not my typing speed."

### What Marcin can offer that agencies cannot

| Dimension | Agency | Marcin |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Decision speed | Committee. Multiple stakeholders. Slow. | One person. Same-day decisions. |
| Who does the work | Junior designers and developers, supervised by seniors who are spread thin. | The same senior person who sold you the project, designed it, coded it, and will maintain it. |
| Communication | Through an account manager who translates (poorly) between you and the team. | Direct. No middlemen. No telephone game. |
| Cost | $15K-$40K for a standard SMB website. They have overhead to cover. | $5K-$15K for the same or better quality. No office lease, no account execs, no overhead. |
| Continuity | Staff rotates. The person who started your project may not finish it. | One person, start to finish. |
| Accountability | Diffused across a team. Nobody is personally responsible. | One person. His reputation is on every pixel. |

### What Marcin can offer that cheap freelancers cannot

| Dimension | Cheap Freelancer ($500-$3K) | Marcin |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------|
| Strategy | None. They build what you describe. If you describe the wrong thing, you get the wrong thing. | Diagnosis before prescription. He tells you what your business actually needs, not what you think you need. |
| Quality | Template-based. Looks like every other site in the vertical. | Enterprise-trained design. The difference is visible and felt by every visitor. |
| Reliability | High ghosting rate. No accountability. | 13 years. 100+ projects. Named testimonials from Fortune 500 clients. |
| Technical depth | WordPress install + theme. No custom code, no analytics, no SEO. | Custom code (React/Next.js), GA4 + GTM setup, technical SEO, performance optimization. |
| Post-launch | Gone. You own a static site that degrades over time. | Ongoing support. Retainer option. The site gets better after launch, not worse. |
| Business understanding | None. They take orders. | Former startup founder. Understands P&L, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value. Speaks your language. |

### The "stuck in the middle" risk and how to avoid it

The biggest strategic risk for Marcin is getting stuck in the middle: too expensive for price-sensitive buyers, too unknown for premium buyers. This is the death zone for solo consultants.

The way to avoid it:

1. **Never compete on price.** Always compete on value. Frame every engagement in terms of ROI, not cost. A $10K website that generates $90K in new annual revenue is not expensive -- it is the best investment the business owner will make this year.

2. **Always qualify before quoting.** The Growth Blueprint (or a free strategy call) exists to filter out buyers who cannot afford the work and to educate buyers who can. Never put a price in front of someone who has not heard the diagnosis.

3. **Use the "burned before" buyer as the primary target.** This buyer has already tried the cheap option and knows it does not work. They are not price-shopping. They are trust-shopping. Marcin's credentials, track record, and guarantee are designed to win this buyer.

4. **Let the case studies do the positioning.** A portfolio with Northern Trust, a healthcare investment platform, and a 290% traffic growth story does not need to argue about price. It argues about competence. The price follows naturally.

## 5. Niche Deep-Dive

### Niche 1: Home Services (HVAC, Plumbing, Roofing, Electrical, Landscaping)

**Market size:**
- Approximately 3.5 million home service businesses in the US
- Cleveland metro has several thousand in this category
- Average revenue for established companies: $1M-$5M
- Industry growing at 5-7% annually

**Average deal size potential:**
- Website project: $7,500-$12,000
- Monthly retainer: $1,200-$2,000
- First-year LTV per client: $12,000-$24,000 (project + retainer)
- The highest-value projects combine website + SEO + Google Business Profile optimization

**Competition level:**
- LOW for the quality tier Marcin occupies. There are many cheap WordPress template shops ($1K-$3K) and a few national platforms (Scorpion, ServiceTitan marketing) but almost nobody offering senior-level custom strategy + build + ongoing management for the $7K-$15K range.
- The template shops compete on volume and low price. Marcin competes on results and relationship.
- No identifiable competitor in Cleveland offers the "Digital Growth Architect" positioning for this vertical.

**Marcin's natural credibility:**
- STRONG. The 290% traffic growth / 12x leads result is from a home service company at Comrade.
- 6 years at Comrade meant working with home service companies constantly. He knows their operations, seasonal patterns, and specific digital challenges.
- The "plain English" communication style is critical here. Contractors do not want jargon. They want someone who tells them what to do and does it.

**Where these buyers hang out:**
- Local trade association meetings (HVAC, plumbing, electrical contractor associations)
- BNI chapters (Business Network International -- heavy with trades)
- Supply house counters (Ferguson, Johnstone Supply -- where contractors gossip)
- Facebook groups for local trades businesses
- Industry trade shows (AHR Expo, PHCC Connect, local home shows)
- They do NOT read marketing blogs or follow LinkedIn thought leaders

**Verdict: #1 RECOMMENDATION**

---

### Niche 2: Healthcare Services (Dental, Chiropractic, Physical Therapy, Med Spas, Senior Care)

**Market size:**
- Over 200,000 dental practices in the US alone
- Cleveland metro has a strong healthcare concentration
- Average revenue for multi-provider practices: $1M-$10M
- Healthcare services spend 5-8% of revenue on marketing

**Average deal size potential:**
- Website project: $8,000-$15,000 (compliance requirements add scope and justify higher pricing)
- Monthly retainer: $1,500-$3,000
- First-year LTV per client: $15,000-$36,000
- HIPAA considerations and multi-location needs increase project complexity and pricing

**Competition level:**
- MODERATE. There are vertical-specific platforms (Smile Marketing, Sesame Communications for dental; PatientPop for medical) but they are expensive, inflexible, and often produce template-driven results. Independent practitioners who combine custom strategy with custom build are rare.
- The dental/medical web space is dominated by either cheap templates or expensive vertical SaaS. The middle tier -- custom, strategic, affordable -- is underserved.

**Marcin's natural credibility:**
- MODERATE-STRONG. The Healthcare Real Estate case study (custom B2B portal, 40% faster deal closing) demonstrates healthcare-adjacent experience. The MDRT engagement shows comfort working in complex organizational contexts.
- He does not have a dental-specific case study yet. He would need to land 1-2 healthcare clients to build vertical proof.

**Where these buyers hang out:**
- Ohio Dental Association, Ohio Physical Therapy Association, and similar state professional organizations
- Local dental study clubs and continuing education events
- Healthcare-specific networking groups
- LinkedIn (healthcare professionals are more active on LinkedIn than contractors)
- Practice management consultants and dental CPAs who advise these buyers

**Verdict: Strong #2 pick. Higher deal sizes and stickier retainers than home services, but requires building healthcare-specific case studies.**

---

### Niche 3: Professional Services (Law Firms, Accounting, Financial Planning, Real Estate Brokerages)

**Market size:**
- Over 400,000 law firms in the US, majority are small practices (2-10 attorneys)
- Thousands of CPA firms, financial advisory practices, and real estate offices
- Average revenue for small professional service firms: $500K-$5M
- Strong concentration in Cleveland market

**Average deal size potential:**
- Website project: $10,000-$18,000 (professional services are accustomed to paying for expertise)
- Monthly retainer: $1,500-$2,500
- First-year LTV per client: $18,000-$30,000
- Professional services firms often need client portals, intake automation, and sophisticated SEO -- higher-value scopes

**Competition level:**
- MODERATE-HIGH. There are many competitors serving law firms specifically (Martindale-Nolo, FindLaw, Scorpion for attorneys). Financial services has compliance-specific platforms (FMG Suite, Broadridge). The generalist mid-tier is less crowded.
- The challenge: professional service firms are sophisticated buyers. They understand hourly billing (they do it themselves). They will evaluate Marcin more rigorously than a contractor would.

**Marcin's natural credibility:**
- MODERATE. Northern Trust (financial services) provides some pedigree. No direct law firm or CPA firm case studies. Would need to build vertical proof.
- The "translation ability" is less of a differentiator here because these buyers are more sophisticated than contractors. The technical execution and strategic thinking are what matter.

**Where these buyers hang out:**
- Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association events
- Ohio Society of CPAs meetings
- Financial planning association local chapters
- LinkedIn (very active demographic)
- State and local professional association conferences
- Business coaching and mastermind groups

**Verdict: #3 pick. Highest deal sizes and most sophisticated buyers, but also most competitive and hardest to break into without vertical-specific case studies.**

### Ranking and recommendation

| Rank | Niche | Why |
|:----:|-------|-----|
| 1 | Home Services | Existing case study proof. Highest natural credibility from Comrade years. Pain is acute and budget exists. Competition is weak at Marcin's quality tier. Referral networks are tight. |
| 2 | Healthcare Services | Higher deal sizes and stickier retainers. Multi-location complexity justifies premium pricing. Moderate competition. Needs 1-2 case studies to become credible. |
| 3 | Professional Services | Highest potential deal sizes but most competitive and most demanding buyers. Requires the most proof-building before credibility is established. |

**The recommendation: Start with Home Services. Expand to Healthcare once 2-3 home service case studies are documented (months 6-12). Consider Professional Services in Year 2 when the reputation and referral network are established.**

The beauty of this sequence is that each niche funds the entry into the next. Home service clients generate cash flow and case studies. Healthcare clients generate higher LTV and open referral doors into professional services. By month 18, Marcin has case studies in all three verticals and can serve whichever produces the best pipeline.

## 6. Positioning Statement

### The full positioning document

**For** owner-operators of established small businesses ($500K-$5M revenue) whose digital presence is underperforming -- losing customers to competitors, invisible on Google, not converting visitors into leads

**Who** have been burned by agencies, ghosted by freelancers, or underwhelmed by DIY website builders and need someone they can actually trust to make their online presence work

**Nice Right** is the **Digital Growth Architect**

**That** diagnoses exactly where your digital presence is losing you money, designs and builds the system that fixes it, and stays accountable for results -- so your website becomes your best salesperson instead of your most expensive brochure

**Unlike** agencies (who charge 3-5x more and rotate junior staff through your project), freelancers (who build what you describe and disappear), or template platforms (that look fine but convert nobody)

**We** combine Fortune 500 design discipline, 100+ SMB projects of proven pattern recognition, full-stack technical execution, and former startup founder business acumen -- all in a single senior practitioner who handles strategy, design, and code directly, delivers at agency speed, and speaks your language instead of tech jargon.

### Condensed versions

**One paragraph:**
Nice Right is the Digital Growth Architect for small businesses that are done guessing. Marcin Dabrowski combines 13 years of digital expertise -- including 100+ SMB projects, Fortune 500 design systems, and a venture-backed startup -- to diagnose why your online presence is losing you customers and build the system that fixes it. One senior person. Strategy, design, and code. No agency markup, no junior staff, no vanishing freelancers. Just results you can measure.

**Two sentences:**
I find out why your business is invisible online, then I design and build what fixes it -- backed by 100+ projects, Fortune 500 training, and a track record of measurable results. One senior person, no middlemen, and a commitment to keep working until it works.

**One sentence:**
I am the last web hire small businesses make -- one senior strategist and builder who has done this 100+ times, combining Fortune 500 discipline with startup speed to turn underperforming digital presence into revenue.

**One line for a business card:**
Digital Growth Architect. 100+ projects. Yours should work.

### How to use this positioning

**On the website:** The homepage headline and subheadline should reflect the core message. The About section should tell the origin story. The case studies should be framed as "architecture projects" -- not "I built a website" but "I diagnosed the problem, designed the system, and built it." The pricing section should lead with the Growth Blueprint as the entry point.

**On LinkedIn:** Update the headline to "Digital Growth Architect for Small Businesses | 100+ Projects | Fortune 500 UX Training | I Design and Build What Gets You Customers." Post one tactical observation per week from the 100+ project experience. Share website teardowns. Comment on small business topics with specific, useful advice.

**In networking conversations:** "I am a Digital Growth Architect. That means I figure out why a small business's website is not bringing in customers, then I design and build what fixes it. I have done it over 100 times. Most people find me after they have been burned by an agency or a freelancer -- and I am the last person they need to hire."

**In sales calls:** Lead with the diagnosis, not the pitch. "Tell me about your business. What does a great month look like? How do new customers find you?" Then share one specific observation about their website. Then offer the Growth Blueprint as the logical next step.

**In referral asks:** "Do you know any business owner who has complained about their website not bringing in customers?" -- specific enough to trigger a memory. Do not ask "Do you know anyone who needs a website?" -- too vague.

### What needs to change immediately

1. **Homepage headline:** Replace "Grow your business. We'll handle the tech." with "Your website should sell for you." or "Stop losing customers to your website."
2. **Subheadline:** Replace the current generic copy with the "I help" statement defined above.
3. **Title and meta:** Replace "Websites, Apps & Digital Growth for Small Businesses" with "Digital Growth Architect for Small Businesses | Nice Right"
4. **Footer:** Replace "Digital growth for small businesses" with "Digital Growth Architecture for businesses that are done guessing."
5. **About section:** Reframe around the architect narrative and the origin story. Lead with "After 100+ projects, I know what makes small businesses grow online -- and what wastes their money."
6. **Services section:** Reframe from "What You Get" (deliverables) to "How I Architect Your Growth" (methodology). Name the process. Make it feel proprietary.
7. **Pricing section:** Lead with the Growth Blueprint as the entry point. Tighten the project range from $5K-$15K to $8K-$12K. Add a guarantee. Add urgency/scarcity that is specific and honest.
8. **LinkedIn:** Update headline, write the announcement post, begin weekly tactical content.

The positioning alone does not generate leads. But it changes the game from "convince people I am worth the price" to "show up as the obvious choice for people who have the problem I solve." That is the difference between a commodity and a category of one.
