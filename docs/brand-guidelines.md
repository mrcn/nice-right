# Nice Right Brand Identity Guidelines

## Brand Essence

**The Calm Expert in a Chaotic Digital World**

Nice Right represents the antidote to overwhelming tech decisions. While other developers speak in jargon and overpromise, Nice Right delivers clarity, reliability, and results. The brand embodies the feeling of finding someone who just "gets it"—and gets it done right.

## Brand Positioning

### What We Are

- A trusted technical partner for small and mid-size businesses
- The bridge between business goals and technical execution
- 13 years of experience distilled into straightforward solutions

### What We're Not

- A faceless agency with account managers and handoffs
- A "we do everything" shop that masters nothing
- Cheap, quick fixes that create long-term problems

### Differentiation

**"When you work with Nice Right, you work directly with Marcin — start to finish."**

No account managers. No junior developers. No surprises. Just direct collaboration with the person actually building your solution.

## Brand Personality

### Voice & Tone

**Primary Voice: Professional Confidence**

- Clear and direct, never condescending
- Expert without being arrogant
- Warm without being overly casual

**Tone Guidelines:**

- **Use sentence case** for all headings (not all lowercase)
- **Avoid cheesy taglines** - no "empowering your digital journey"
- **Speak like a trusted advisor**, not a salesperson
- **Use contractions naturally** (I'll, don't, can't) for approachability
- **Lead with benefits**, not features

### Voice Examples

| Instead of...                                         | Use...                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We empower businesses to leverage digital solutions" | "I'll handle the tech so you can focus on your business"   |
| "Our comprehensive suite of services"                 | "Three ways I help businesses grow"                        |
| "Transform your online presence"                      | "Get found by customers who are looking for you right now" |
| "Best-in-class development"                           | "13 years building websites that actually work"            |
