**For:** Marcin Dabrowski / niceright.co
**Status:** Strategy defined. Ready to build landing page + start outreach.

## The Decision: Hyper-Local Portage Park / Six Corners

**Location:** Addison & Cicero, Chicago — Portage Park neighborhood, adjacent to Six Corners shopping district, near Belmont-Cragin and Old Irving Park.

**The positioning:**
> "I help Portage Park and Six Corners businesses get more customers from their website."

**Why hyper-local wins:**
1. Can walk to clients — trust signal no remote freelancer can match
2. Word of mouth is nuclear in tight neighborhoods (HVAC guy tells plumber tells electrician)
3. Nobody owns this territory — zero consultants positioned as "the website guy for Portage Park"
4. Portage Park Chamber of Commerce (portageparkchamber.org) and Six Corners Association (sixcorners.com) = built-in networking
5. Marcin already knows 1-2 local business owners — founding clients
6. Dense small business corridor: home services, restaurants, dental/medical, auto, retail

**Target businesses in the area:**
- Home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing) — #1 priority, 290%/12x case study is from this vertical
- Restaurants (Polish, Mexican, Guatemalan, Peruvian — tons in the area)
- Dental/medical practices (Z Dental Care, Portage Park Dental, Dental Masters)
- Contractors and trades
- Small retail and services along Cicero Ave and Milwaukee Ave

**Niche recommendation from all research:** Home services first, then expand to restaurants and dental once case studies are built.

## The Hormozi $100M Offers Framework — Applied

### The Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)
```

| Lever | Current (broken) | Grand Slam version |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | "A better website" (vague) | "Your phone rings more. Your calendar fills up." (money) |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | Low — no independent proof visible | HIGH — 100+ projects, 290%/12x stats, Northern Trust, agency years |
| **Time Delay** | Unclear timelines | 14 days or it's free |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | Client has to figure out 4 offers, go through sales process | "One 60-minute call. I handle everything else." |

**The Grand Slam pitch:**
> "I will build you a website that brings in more customers — backed by the same results I've delivered 100+ times — in 14 days — and all you do is show up for one call."

### The Offer Stack

**Core offer:** Complete website build — $6,000

| Bonus | What it is | "Value" | Cost to Marcin |
|-------|-----------|--------:|---------------:|
| Google Business Profile overhaul | Optimize listing, photos, review strategy | $1,000 | 1 hour |
| SEO foundation | Meta tags, schema, sitemap, Search Console | $2,000 | 2 hours |
| Competitor intelligence report | What 3 competitors do better + how to beat them | $1,500 | 1 hour (AI-assisted) |
| Analytics dashboard | GA4 + conversion tracking | $750 | 45 min |
| 30-day post-launch optimization | Monitor, tweak, improve based on real data | $2,000 | 3 hours |
| "Is this worth it?" hotline | Text any digital question for 90 days | $500 | 5 min/question |

**Total stack value:** ~$20,000
**Price:** $6,000
**Value-to-price ratio:** 3.3x

### The Guarantee (3 layers)

1. **Unconditional:** "14 days or it's free." Miss the timeline = full refund of deposit.
2. **Conditional:** "If your new site doesn't generate more leads than your old one within 90 days, I keep working for free until it does."
3. **Implied:** "Month-to-month retainer. Fire me any time. Keep everything I built."

### The Naming (MAGIC Formula)

| Old name | Hormozi MAGIC name |
|----------|-------------------|
| Website Audit | **The Revenue Leak Report** |
| Website Build | **The 14-Day Growth Machine** |
| Monthly Retainer | **The Invisible Department** |
| Competitive SEO | **The 90-Day Competitor Funeral** |

### Scarcity (Real, Not Fake)

- "I take 3 new builds per month. That's it. I'm one person doing senior-level work."
- Founding rate: "First 5 clients at 30% off. In exchange: case study + testimonial."

## The Offer Ladder (what to sell, in order)

| Step | Offer | Price | Purpose |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **0** | Free mini-teardown video (3 min Loom) | $0 | Outreach tool — demonstrate competence before asking for anything |
| **1** | **The $500 Teardown** | $500-750 | Entry point. Fast decision. "Is my site broken?" Delivered in 5 days. |
| **2** | **The 14-Day Growth Machine** | $5K-6K | Core cash engine. "Done in 2 weeks or it's free." $3K deposit / $3K at launch. |
| **3** | **The Invisible Department** | $1,500/mo | Revenue floor. One tier. Month-to-month. No contract. |
| **4** | **The Competitor Funeral** | $12K | Premium. "Name your competitor. 90 days. I bury them online." |
| **5** | **Weekly Teardown Show** | Free | LinkedIn content engine. Makes everything else easier to sell. |

**Full client LTV through the ladder:** $500 + $6,000 + ($1,500 x 12) + $12,000 = **$36,500**

## The Pitch (what Marcin actually says)

### First contact (cold outreach via Loom):
> "Hey [Name], I'm Marcin — I help businesses in Portage Park get more customers from their website. I drove past [Business Name] and pulled up your site. Found a few things that might be costing you customers. Recorded a quick video — no strings."

### When they respond:
> "Want the full deep-dive? $500, delivered in 5 days. I'll show you exactly where the money is leaking and how to fix it — whether you hire me or not."

### The 30-second networking pitch:
> "You know how most small businesses pay for a website and it never brings in a single customer? I fix that. I've done it over a hundred times — everything from local plumbers to Northern Trust. I figure out why a business is invisible online and build what fixes it."

### The one-liner:
> "I help Portage Park businesses get found on Google and turn their website into their best salesperson. Done it 100+ times. 14 days or it's free."

## The Math to $15-20K/Month

| Month | Revenue | How |
|------:|--------:|-----|
| 1 | $5K-14K | 50 warm network messages + first teardowns + first site build |
| 3 | $10K-18K | Pipeline building, first retainer client signs |
| 5-7 | $15K+ | Retainer floor building + 1-2 site builds/month |
| 12 | $20K+ | 6-8 retainer clients ($9K-12K floor) + projects on top |

**Year 1 realistic:** $170K-$200K
**Break-even:** Month 3-4 at ~$8,700/month
**Cash runway needed:** $15K-$20K for months 1-2

### Revenue at Steady State (Month 7+)

| Source | Monthly | % of Total |
|--------|--------:|:----------:|
| Invisible Department (6-8 clients x $1,500) | $9,000-$12,000 | 55-60% |
| 14-Day Growth Machine (1-2/month x $6,000) | $6,000-$12,000 | 25-35% |
| Competitor Funeral (1/quarter, amortized) | $4,000 | 10-15% |
| Teardowns (2-3 x $500) | $1,000-$1,500 | 5-8% |
| **Total** | **$20,000-$29,500** | 100% |

## 6 Overlooked Assets

1. **290%/12x stat** — Should lead every outreach, not be buried in a counter animation
2. **Northern Trust animations** — Live on northerntrust.com right now. Every Chicago business owner knows the name.
3. **100+ projects** — Proprietary database of SMB patterns, not just a number
4. **Sparkblox failure** ($1M raised) — Best conversation opener, not something to hide
5. **Testimonials praise translation/understanding** — The real product is different from what the site sells
6. **Chicago northwest side low competition** — Visibility is the only problem at his quality tier

## First 30 Days Action Plan

### Week 1: Activate (Days 1-7)
- Day 1-2: Send 50 personalized messages to warm network (Comrade, Northern Trust, DEPT, Sparkblox, personal)
- Day 2-3: Record first 3 teardown show episodes for local businesses, post on LinkedIn
- Day 3-5: Record 20 free mini-teardowns for Portage Park businesses, send via email
- Day 5-7: LinkedIn announcement post

### Week 2: First Revenue (Days 8-14)
- Conduct first 2-3 paid teardowns ($500 each)
- Continue mini-teardown outreach (10 more)
- Post teardown show episode #4
- At end of each teardown call: present next step (quick fixes or 14-Day Growth Machine)

### Week 3: Build Mode (Days 15-21)
- Deliver first 14-Day Growth Machine if closed
- Post teardown show episodes #5-6
- Continue outreach (5-10 more mini-teardowns)
- Attend first Chamber/networking event

### Week 4: Momentum (Days 22-30)
- Complete first project + close second

- **Month 1 revenue target: $5,000-$14,000**

### The Sacred Rule
> The morning sales block (8:00-10:30am) is non-negotiable. Client work happens after. Sales = survival.

## Critical Fixes Before Launch

1. **Contact form is broken** — handleSubmit in ContactSection.tsx only sets submitted=true client-side. No backend. Every submission is silently lost. MUST fix with Formspree, Resend, or equivalent.
2. **Hero says "20 minutes" but Cal.com is configured for 30min** — mismatch needs fixing.
3. **PLACEHOLDER_CLARITY_ID in layout.tsx** — Either get real Microsoft Clarity ID or remove.
4. **Rebuild the homepage/landing page** around this offer strategy (replaces the 3-card pricing grid).

---

## Landing Page Structure (to build next)

1. **Hero** — "Your website should sell for you." + one-line sub
2. **Pain** — "Sound familiar?" (burned by agency, ghosted by freelancer, DIY nobody found)
3. **The free offer** — "I'll record a free video showing you what's costing you customers. 3 minutes. Your site. No strings."
4. **Proof** — 290% / 12x / 100+ / Northern Trust — big and loud
5. **How it works** — 3 steps: I diagnose, I build, I keep it growing
6. **Origin story** — Michelin chef angle (short, punchy)
7. **One CTA** — Book a call or drop your URL for a free teardown
8. No pricing grid. No tiers. Pricing happens on the call.
