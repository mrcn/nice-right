My background in music production, where I gained a small following during the Myspace era, gave me an early glimpse into the power of having dedicated fans. Back then, the connection between creators and their audience was somewhat immediate and rewarding. But as the landscape shifted with Facebook’s rise, my online success waned, and I witnessed how platform-driven ecosystems could erode those connections.

I carry that experience with me today.

**On one hand**, I remain a creative, always exploring new ways to extend artistic mediums. In the NFT space, I find myself inspired by dynamic and interactive art, reminiscent of what I saw while working with tools like MAX/MSP, VVVV, and Pure Data. These tools were playgrounds for creating visuals that responded to dynamic inputs like time or context – a concept that feels especially relevant in the programmable world of NFTs.

**On the other hand**, one of my greatest hopes for the NFT space is to see artists and fans alike rewarded as broader markets align in their favor. NFTs hold the potential to deepen the bond between creators and their supporters, creating systems where artistic and economic value grow in tandem.

## **Art and Value: Time as a Creative Medium**

Recently during a conversation at Art Basel in Miami (2021), we explored the relationship between time, art, and value. We talked about how time can transform a piece of art – whether through market valuation, audience perception, or the artwork’s properties itself. This discussion sparked an idea: what if time and economic value could directly influence the artwork itself?

NFTs open up fascinating possibilities for this. Take a simple example:

- Imagine an SVG (a scalable vector graphic) that evolves programmatically, with parameters updated via API.
- Its visual appearance changes in response to algorithmically determined inputs – like the price of the artwork or the time since its last sale.
## **The Role of Bonded Curves in Dynamic Pricing**

One of the tools that make this possible is a **bonded curve**, a pricing mechanism widely used in decentralized finance (DeFi). Bonded curves allow the price of an asset to adjust predictably based on supply or demand. For example, as more pieces of an NFT series sell, the price could increase incrementally.

In the NFT context, bonded curves don’t just adjust prices—they can also serve as inputs for the art itself. For instance:

- The higher the price, the more intricate or colorful the artwork becomes.
- Early buyers see a simpler version of the piece, while later buyers witness its evolution into a more complex form.
This interplay between algorithmic pricing and programmable art introduces a new dimension to NFTs. The artwork and its value are no longer static; they are dynamic, interconnected, and responsive.

## **Triggers for Transformation**

The possibilities don’t end. Pricing algorithms can integrate a variety of triggers to influence both the art and its value:

- **Time-Based Triggers:** The artwork evolves gradually over time, revealing new elements at regular intervals.
- **Sales Events:** Every sale alters the piece, adding, removing, or enhancing features.
- **Frequency of Transactions:** Faster trading might produce more dramatic visual changes, while slower trading results in subtler shifts.
This convergence creates a living relationship between the artwork and its economic context. Imagine owning a piece that grows and transforms not just based on your interactions but on the collective activity surrounding it.

## **A New Frontier for Artists and Fans**

This dynamic approach to NFTs has profound implications for both artists and collectors:

- **For Artists:** Programmable NFTs offer a way to embed surprise into the artwork’s lifecycle. They can design pieces that grow alongside their audience, rewarding early supporters and evolving with time.
- **For Fans:** Collectors become participants in the art’s journey. They influence its shape, value, and meaning, creating a deeper connection to the work.
At the same time, these mechanisms blur the line between artistic and economic value such that the art isn’t just a reflection of creative intent – it is a real-time product of the market value.

## **The Future of Dynamic Art**

The convergence of dynamic visuals and algorithmic pricing helps us reimagine ways to create and engage with art. Tools like SVGs and on-chain data enable low-barrier programmable experiences that adapt to time, context, and community interaction.

As the NFT space matures, these ideas have the potential to reshape not just how we think about art, but how we define value itself. Whether it’s through evolving visuals, market-driven inputs, or fan-driven engagement, the possibilities are as vast as they are exciting.

The question now is: how will artists, technologists, and fans unlock this potential?
