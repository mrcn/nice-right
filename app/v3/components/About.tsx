            <h2>Running a small business is hard enough without worrying about whether your website is costing you customers.</h2>
            <p>
              You shouldn&apos;t have to become a tech expert just to compete online.
              You need someone who understands what actually drives results for
              businesses like yours &mdash; and can build it without the runaround.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m Marcin. I started building websites 13 years ago, spent 6 years
              at a digital marketing agency, and have delivered over 100 projects for
              small and mid-size businesses. Along the way, I also contracted with
              Fortune 500 companies and co-founded a startup. All of that sharpened
              how I think about your business &mdash; what to prioritize, what to skip,
              and where the real opportunities are.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you work with Nice Right, you work directly with me &mdash; the same
              person from first call to final launch. Your project gets my full attention.
              No account managers. No juniors learning on your dime. Just someone who&apos;s
              done this over a hundred times and genuinely cares about getting it right.
