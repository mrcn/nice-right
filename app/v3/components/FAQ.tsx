              Every project starts with a focused look at your business, your
              customers, and where the real opportunities are. You&apos;ll see
              the strategy and expected outcomes before any work begins. After
              launch, we review real data together and adjust whatever needs it.
              You&apos;ll have evidence at every step &mdash; not just promises.

            <p className="v2-faq-a">
              You get one senior person who understands your full picture, rather
              than being passed between team members who each know a slice.
              For projects that genuinely need extra hands, I bring in trusted
              specialists. But you always have a single point of contact who
              knows your business inside out.

            <p className="v2-faq-q">&ldquo;How is this different from an agency?&rdquo;</p>
            <p className="v2-faq-a">
              I worked inside agencies for years &mdash; I know how they operate.
              Your project typically goes through account managers and gets
              assigned to whoever&apos;s available that week. With Nice Right,
              you work directly with a senior strategist and builder &mdash; the
              same person, start to finish. That means faster decisions, deeper
              understanding of your business, and pricing that reflects the work.

            <p className="v2-faq-a">
              That&apos;s the most common starting point &mdash; and exactly what
              the free call is for. I&apos;ll look at where your business is today,
              what your competitors are doing, and where the real opportunities are.
              Then I&apos;ll tell you plainly what would move the needle. Sometimes
              it&apos;s a new site. Sometimes it&apos;s three changes to the one
              you have.

            <p className="v2-faq-q">&ldquo;How long until I see results?&rdquo;</p>
            <p className="v2-faq-a">
              Most projects go live within 4&ndash;8 weeks. Quick wins like speed
              improvements, SEO fixes, or conversion tweaks often show results
              within days of launch. Bigger outcomes &mdash; more traffic, more
              leads &mdash; build over your first 2&ndash;3 months. I&apos;ll set
              realistic timelines up front so you know exactly what to expect.

            <p className="v2-faq-q">&ldquo;What happens after my site launches?&rdquo;</p>
            <p className="v2-faq-a">
              Your site doesn&apos;t stop needing attention when it goes live. I
              include a post-launch review to measure real results, and I&apos;m
              available for ongoing support. You&apos;re never left wondering
              &ldquo;what now?&rdquo; &mdash; you&apos;ll have a clear plan for
              what comes next.
