# fn-1-ac7.2 Pricing & Messaging: Performance Partnership

## Description

Create pricing page and messaging framework for the performance-based model. Communicate "small base fee + commission" professionally while emphasizing risk reversal and partnership positioning.

**Size:** M  
**Files:**
- app/pricing/page.tsx
- Updates to app/page.tsx (CTA sections, possibly hero)

### Pricing Page Structure

**Hero Section:**
- Headline: "Performance Partnership" or similar
- Subhead: "Small base fee. Commission on results. We only win when you win."

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Base Fee: $300-400/month (position as "operational cost coverage")
- Commission: 5-15% of provable results (tiered by engagement type)
- 3-month minimum, then month-to-month

**How It Works:**
1. We install tracking on your site
2. We make improvements (UX, conversion, traffic)
3. You see results in your dashboard
4. Commission calculated on attributed revenue

**Risk Reversal Elements:**
- 3-month trial with clear exit criteria
- Month-to-month after trial
- No long-term contracts
- Transparent tracking — you see what we see

**FAQ Section:**
- How is commission calculated?
- What counts as a "result"?
- What if we don't see improvement?
- How does the 3-month trial work?

### Messaging Framework

**Primary Positioning:**
- "Performance Partnership" — not "agency pricing"
- "We invest in your success" — aligns incentives
- "Skin in the game" — we share risk

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Transparent about the model
- Focus on client outcomes, not our process
- Small-business friendly (no enterprise jargon)

## Approach

- Create new /pricing page
- Update homepage CTAs to reference performance model
- Use existing visual patterns (cards, grids, accent colors)
- Include social proof if available (case study results)

## Key Context

- Current site uses "Digital Growth Partner" positioning
- Services section lists: Get More Customers, Lower Service Costs, Keep Them Longer
- Need to bridge existing positioning with new pricing model

## Acceptance

- [ ] Pricing page at /pricing with all sections
- [ ] Clear explanation of base fee + commission structure
- [ ] Risk reversal elements prominent (3-month trial, month-to-month)
- [ ] FAQ addresses common objections
- [ ] Homepage updated with performance partnership messaging
- [ ] All copy follows tone guidelines
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout
- [ ] CTA to calculator tools (cross-link)
